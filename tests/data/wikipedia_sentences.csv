1,"Michael John Kavanagh (born 6 April 1979) is an Irish former hurler who played as a right corner-back for the Kilkenny senior team.

Born in Freshford, County Kilkenny, Kavanagh first played competitive hurling during his schooling at St. Kieran's College. He arrived on the inter-county scene at the age of sixteen when he first linked up with the Kilkenny minor team, before later joining the under-21 side. He joined the senior team during the 1998 championship. Kavanagh immediately became a regular member of the starting fifteen, and won seven All-Ireland medals, ten Leinster medals and five National League medals on the field of play. He was an All-Ireland runner-up on three occasions.

As a member of the Leinster inter-provincial team on a number of occasions, Kavanagh won two Railway Cup medals. At club level he is an All-Ireland medallist with St Lachtain's in the intermediate grade. In addition to this he has also won a set of Leinster and championship medals.

Throughout his career Kavanagh made 48 championship appearances. He announced his retirement from inter-county hurling on 9 February 2012.

In 2002 Kavanagh won the first of four All-Star awards. He was also chosen as one of the 125 greatest hurlers of all-time in a 2009 poll. That same year Kavanagh was chosen on the Leinster team of the past twenty-five years.

In retirement from playing Kavanagh became involved in team management and coaching. In 2015 he was appointed trainer to the Wicklow senior team.

Playing career

Colleges

During his schooling at St Kieran's College in Kilkenny, Kavanagh established himself as a key member of the senior hurling team. In 1996 he won his sole Leinster medal as Good Counsel College were narrowly defeated by 1-7 to 1-6. St Colman's College provided the opposition in the subsequent All-Ireland decider. A 1-14 to 2-6 victory gave Kavanagh an All-Ireland medal.

University 

During his studies at the Waterford Institute of Technology, Kavanagh was an automatic inclusion on the college hurling team. In 2004 he was at right corner-back as WIT faced University College Cork in the final of the Fitzgibbon Cup. Two goals from Declan Browne in a six-minute spell before half-time gave WIT a commanding lead. Neil Ronan bagged a fourth goal straight after the interval which helped WIT to a 4-15 to 3-12 victory.

Kavanagh lined out in a second successive Fitzgibbon Cup decider in 2000. University College Dublin were the opponents on that occasion, however, a 2-10 to 1-6 victory gave WIT the victory. It was Kavanagh's second Fitzgibbon Cup medal.

Club

After a lengthy career with St Lachtain's, Kavangh lined out in his first intermediate decider in 2009. A narrow 0-16 to 1-11 defeat of Dicksboro gave him a championship medal. Kavanagh later added a Leinster medal to his collection when St Lachtain's secured a 1-8 to 0-7 defeat of Mount Leinster Rangers to take the provincial title for the first time. On 13 February 2010 St Lachtain's faced St Gall's in the All-Ireland decider. John Fitzpatrick (two) and Ollie O'Connor hit the goals that helped secure a comprehensive 3-17 to 0-10 victory and an All-Ireland Intermediate Club Hurling Championship medal for Kavanagh.

Inter-county

Minor and under-21

Kavanagh first played for Kilkenny in 1995 when he joined the minor side. He won his first Leinster medal that year following a 4-16 to 2-6 defeat of Offaly. The subsequent All-Ireland decider pitted Kilkenny against old rivals Cork, with Kavanagh lining out at right corner-back. The game turned into a rout as Cork won easily by 2-10 to 1-2.

In 1996 Kavanagh won his second Leinster medal, as Dublin were accounted for on a 1-16 to 1-11 score line. The All-Ireland campaign came to an end at the semi-final stage.

Kavanagh was eligible for the minor grade again in 1997. A 3-16 to 1-10 defeat of Offaly gave him a third successive Leinster medal, however, his quest for an All-Ireland medal came to an end at the semi-final stage.

In 1998 Kavanagh was drafted onto the Kilkenny under-21 team. A 2-10 to 0-12 defeat of Dublin in the provincial decider gave him his first Leinster medal in that grade.

Kavanagh won a second Leinster medal in 1999, following a 1-17 to 1-6 trouncing of Offaly. The subsequent All-Ireland decider was a thrilling affair, with Kilkenny securing a narrow 1-13 to 0-14 defeat of Galway to give Kavanagh his sole All-Ireland medal.

Unsuccessful beginnings

Kavanagh was just out of the minor grade when he joined the Kilkenny senior team in 1999. He made his senior championship debut on 31 May 1998 in a 4-23 to 0-14 Leinster quarter-final defeat of Dublin. Kavanagh later won his first Leinster medal following a 3-10 to 1-11 defeat of Offaly. The subsequent All-Ireland decider on 13 September 1998 saw both sides face off against each other in a first all-Leinster affair. Offaly's Brian Whelahan, who was suffering from flu, delivered one of his greatest ever performances. After starting in defence he was later moved to full-forward where he scored 1–6. Offaly reversed the Leinster final defeat by winning the All-Ireland final by 2–16 to 1–13.

Kilkenny gained their revenge on Offaly in the 1999 provincial final. A huge 5–14 to 1–16 victory over their near rivals gave Kilkenny the win and gave Kavanagh a second Leinster medal. The subsequent All-Ireland decider saw Kilkenny face Cork on 12 September 1999. In a dour contest played on a wet day, Cork trailed by 0-5 to 0-4 after a low-scoring first half. Kilkenny increased the pace after the interval, pulling into a four-point lead. Cork moved up a gear and through Joe Deane, Ben O'Connor and Seánie McGrath Cork scored five unanswered points. Kilkenny could only manage one more score – a point from a Henry Shefflin free – and Cork held out to win by 0-13 to 0-12.

Early successes

In 2000 Kavanagh won a third successive Leinster medal following another comfortable 2–21 to 1–13 victory over Offaly.  As a result of the so-called ""back-door"" system both sides later faced off against each other again in the All-Ireland final on 10 September 2000.  D.J. Carey capitalised on an Offaly mistake after just six minutes to start a goal-fest for 'the Cats'.  Carey scored 2–4 in all, sharing his second goal with Henry Shefflin who also scored a goal in the second-half.  At the full-time whistle Kilkenny were the champions by 5–15 to 1–14 and Kavanagh collected his first All-Ireland medal.

Kilkenny's provincial dominance continued in 2001 and a powerful 2-19 to 0-12 defeat of Wexford gave Kavanagh a fourth Leinster medal.

Kilkenny bounced back in 2002. Kavanagh won his first National League medal, as a late Brian Dowling free secured a narrow 2-15 to 2-14 victory. He later collected a fifth Leinster medal as Kilkenny recorded a narrow 0-19 to 0-17 defeat of fourteen-man Wexford. On 8 September 2002 Kavanagh lined out in his fourth All-Ireland decider as Kilkenny faced first-round losers Clare. Kilkenny forwards Henry Shefflin and D. J. Carey combined to score 2-13 between them, as Kilkenny secured a 2-20 to 0-19 victory. It was a second All-Ireland medal for Kavanagh while he was later honoured with his first All-Star award.

In 2003 Kavanagh won a second league medal as Kilkenny came back from eight points down to secure a stunning 5-14 to 5-13 extra-time defeat of Tipperary. He later won a sixth successive Leinster medal, as Kilkenny defeated Wexford by 2-23 to 2-12. The subsequent All-Ireland final on 14 September 2003 saw Kilkenny face Cork for the first time in four years. Both teams remained level for much of the game, exchanging tit-for-tat scores. A Setanta Ó hAilpín goal gave Cork the advantage, however, a Martin Comerford goal five minutes from the end settled the game as Kilkenny went on to win by 1-14 to 1-11. It was Kavanagh's third All-Ireland medal. He was later honoured with his second All-Star award.

After facing a shock, last-minute 2-15 to 1-16 defeat by Wexford in the Leinster semi-final in 2004, Kilkenny worked their way through the qualifiers and lined out against Cork in the All-Ireland decider on 12 September 2004. The game was expected to be a classic, however, a rain-soaked day made conditions difficult as Kilkenny aimed to secure a third successive championship. The first half was a low-scoring affair and provided little excitement for fans, however, the second half saw Cork completely take over. For the last twenty-three minutes Cork scored nine unanswered points and went on to win the game by 0-17 to 0-9.

Kilkenny were back in form in 2005, with Kavanagh winning a third National League medal following a 3–20 to 0–15 victory over Clare. ""The Cats"" later struggled against a wasteful Wexford side, however, a 0-22 to 1-16 victory gave Kavanagh a seventh Leinster medal. While a third successive All-Ireland showdown with Cork seemed likely, Galway defeated Kilkenny in the All-Ireland semi-final in one of the games of the decade.

Four-in-a-row

In 2006 Kavanagh captured a fourth National League title following a 3–11 to 0–14 victory over Limerick.  After missing the Leinster final triumph, Kavanagh was back on the starting fifteen for the All-Ireland final. The game that everyone had predicted would happen in 2005 was now taking place as Cork squared up to Kilkenny for the third time in four years. The Leesiders were aiming for a third All-Ireland victory in-a-row; however, revenge was foremost in the minds of Kilkenny as it was Cork who denied their three-in-a-row bid in 2004. On the day Kilkenny were far too strong for Cork as 'the Cats' secured a 1–16 to 1–13 victory. It was Kavanagh's fourth All-Ireland winners' medal.

Kavanagh collected an eighth Leinster medal in 2007, as Kilkenny asserted their provincial dominance and defeated Wexford by 2-24 to 1-12. On 2 September 2007 Kilkenny faced defeated Munster finalists and surprise All-Ireland semi-final winners Limerick in the championship decider. Kilkenny got off to a flying start with Eddie Brennan and Henry Shefflin scoring two goals within the first ten minutes to set the tone. Limerick launched a second-half comeback, however, ""the Cats"" were too powerful and cruised to a 2-19 to 1-15 victory. It was Kavanagh's fifth All-Ireland medal.

Kilkenny secured the Leinster crown again in 2008, with Kavanagh collecting a ninth winners' medal following a 5-21 to 0-17 drubbing of Wexford. On 8 September 2008 Kilkenny faced Waterford in the All-Ireland decider for the first time in forty-five years. In a disappointingly one-sided final, Kilkenny produced a near perfect seventy minutes as Waterford endured a nightmare afternoon. A 23-point winning margin, 3-24 from play, only two wides in the entire match and eight scorers in all with Eddie Brennan and Henry Shefflin leading the way in a 3-30 to 1-13 victory. It was Kavanagh's sixth All-Ireland medal.

Kavanagh collected a fifth National League medal in 2009, as Kilkenny beat Tipperary by 2-26 to 4-17 with a thrilling extra-time victory. He later won a fifth successive Leinster medal, his tenth overall, as new challengers Dublin were bested by 2-18 to 0-18. On 6 September Kilkenny were poised to become the second team ever in the history of hurling to win four successive All-Ireland championships when they faced Tipperary in the decider. For long periods Tipp looked the likely winners, however, late goals from Henry Shefflin and substitute Martin Comerford finally killed off their efforts to secure a 2-22 to 0-23 victory. Kavanagh had collected his seventh All-Ireland medal.

Twilight success

In 2010 Kavanagh was dropped from the Kilkenny starting fifteen, however, he remained on the extended panel. Kilkenny faced a number of injury worries going into an historic All-Ireland final, and ultimately failed in their 'drive for five' as Tipperary won by 4–17 to 1-18. Following this defeat it was incorrectly reported that Kavanagh had retired from inter-county hurling.

Kavanagh remained on the Kilkenny panel for the 2011 championship.  That year Kilkenny qualified for a record sixth consecutive All-Ireland final. For the third year in succession the team faced Tipperary, however, on this occasion Kilkenny were slight underdogs going up against the new champions. Kilkenny started quickly and never surrendered the lead in the 2–17 to 1–16 victory.  Kavanagh played no part in the game, however, he collected his eighth All-Ireland medal as a non-playing substitute.

Inter-provincial

In 1998 Kavanagh was a non-playing substitute on the Leinster team that narrowly defeated Connacht by 0-16 to 2-9 in the final of the Railway Cup.

Four years later Kavanagh made it onto the starting fifteen as Leinster faced their age-old rivals Munster in the championship decider. A last-minute free by Henry Shefflin secured a 4-15 to 3-17 victory and a first Railway Cup medal on the field of play for Kavanagh.

Kavanagh was captain of the team in 2003 as Leinster faced Connacht in the final. A 4-9 to 2-12 victory gave him a second successive Railway Cup medal.

Management career

Wicklow

On 27 January 2015 it was announced that Kavanagh had joined the Wicklow senior hurling management team as trainer.

Personal life

Born in Freshford, County Kilkenny, Kavanagh was educated at the local national school before later completing his Leaving Certificate at St. Kieran's college. He subsequently completed a degree at the Waterford Institute of Technology, before later becoming a financial adviser.

2,"Nicholas Briot (about 1579 – 24 December 1646) was an innovative French coin engraver, medallist and mechanical engineer, who emigrated to England and became chief engraver to the Royal Mint in 1633 and is credited with the invention of the coining-press.

France
He was born Nicolas Briot at Damblain, in Lorraine, in the Vosges department of France, a frontier town famous for its bellfounding and metalworking industries. He is one of a distinguished  Huguenot family of patternmakers, diecutters and craftsmen in metal in the 16th and 17th centuries, whose members included Francois Briot, master pewterer and medallist represented in the main national collections (uncle of Nicolas), and Etienne Briot, engraver. His father, Didier, and brother, Isaac, were both notable medallists.

After serving his apprenticeship, Briot travelled to Montbéliard and Langres in 1599, where he produced his first portrait engravings. He migrated to Paris in 1605, where he was appointed engraver-general (chief engraver) at the Monnaie de Paris (Paris Mint) in 1605–6, and produced coronation medals for the young Louis XIII.

He began to experiment with the mechanisation of French coin production, developing improvements in the 'balancier' presses introduced from Nuremberg in Germany for striking coins and promoting a 'mill and engines which will prevent counterfeiting' which he submitted to the Paris authorities in 1615. In that year he published 'Raisons, moyens et propositions pour faire toutes les monnaies du royaume, a l'avenir, uniformes, et pour cesser toutes fabrications, etc.' He promoted the coining press to replace the traditional hammer-striking methods of coinage production, the prototype of which is generally attributed to the engraver Antoine Brucher who had first tried it about 1553 for the coining of counters in the court of Henri III. Briot, however, was unable to convince the French government to adopt his new technology, and was accused of fraud.

England and Scotland
Briot fled to England in 1625, pursued by creditors, and offered his services and machinery to Charles I of England. He met with more success than in France, and in 1626 he was commissioned to make puncheons and dies for 'certain pieces of largesse of gold and silver in memory of his Majesty's coronation', producing his successful Coronation Medal, the first of the sequence of medals for Charles I, in that year. This established his reputation, when he was given 'power and authority to frame and engrave the first designs and effigies of the king's image ... to serve in coins of gold and silver'. He went on to produce a considerable number of dies and moulds for medals and coins in the following years.

In 1633, he was sent to Scotland to prepare and coin the coronation pieces of Charles I, as well as the Scottish Coronation Medal (1633). His Coronation medals and the 'Dominion of the Seas' medal (1630) demonstrated his artistic skill and the technical superiority of the new coining machinery. On the death of Sir John Foulis, Master of the Mint in Scotland, Briot was appointed to the office in 1635, and superintended the Scottish coinage for several years.

Briot was recalled to England by the king and was appointed chief engraver to the Royal Mint in 1633. On the outbreak of the English Civil War he followed Charles I to York and Oxford; 'he took possession of the punches, roller instruments, and coining apparatus at the Tower, by order of his Majesty, and had them removed, trussed up in saddles, at the hazard of his life, for the purpose of continuing the coining operations in the cause of the King'.

He travelled to France in 1641 and 1645, sending presses to his brother Isaac, now in a senior position at the Paris Mint. He died on Christmas Eve 1646.

His dies for coins and medals have been called ""gems of medallic art"".

6,"Jedność (meaning Unity in English) was an independent Polish weekly magazine launched during the August 1980 strike in Szczecin Shipyard. Four months later it became the first opposition publication in the Soviet-dominated Eastern Europe to be allowed by the authorities.

History
In the Communist countries, all publications needed a government license, in Poland called debit, and were subject to prior restraint. The rise of Solidarność created a kind of grey zone: hundreds of local bulletins were launched without ""debits"", thus formally illegal, yet rarely prosecuted. Jedność (full title: Nasz rodowód – sierpień ’80 JEDNOŚĆ, Our origin - August 1980 UNITY) was initially published and distributed in the Szczecin region in this way.

Unlike others, Jedność chief editor Leszek Dlouchy applied for a debit and surprisingly received it soon, with the first fully legal edition published on 3 January 1981. The countrywide Tygodnik Solidarność, the official weekly of the free union's National Coordination Committee, had to wait until May for its ""debit"".

Both papers struggled with the censors who would often ban half of a planned issue, and a sequence of dashes in square brackets, [----], marking the cuts, was often seen in each article. Yet the debit spelled the right of sale in kiosks of the monopolist, state-owned Ruch, while underground and grey zone bulletins could only be distributed hand-to-hand.

Out of 100,000 Jedność copies printed weekly, half was meant for Szczecin and the region, while union members in the national railway PKP would distribute the other half to several Polish cities. Jedność attracted several prominent Polish authors and illustrators, the most notable being Andrzej Mleczko.

The legal existence of both Jedność and Tygodnik Solidarność ended on 13 December 1981, when the Communists declared martial law in Poland. Jedność continued in the underground until the fall of Communism in 1989.

7,"Robert Cuthbert Grieve, VC (19 June 1889 – 4 October 1957) was an Australian recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry ""in the face of the enemy"" that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Early life
Born in Brighton, a suburb of Melbourne, to John and Annie Deas Grieve (née Brown), Grieve was educated at Caulfield Grammar School and then Wesley College. He became an interstate commercial traveller in the softgoods trade.

First World War
After nine months service in the Victorian Rangers, he enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force as a private on 9 June 1915. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the 37th Battalion in January 1916, was promoted to lieutenant in May 1916, and after training in England, was promoted to captain in France in February 1917.

In France he served at Armentières, Bois-Grenier, L'Epinette, Ploegsteert Wood, Messines, La Basse Ville, and Warneton.

He was awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions at Messines. The announcement and accompanying citation for the award was published in a supplement to the London Gazette of 31 July 1917, reading:

Severely wounded in the shoulder by a sniper's bullet, Grieve was evacuated to England, and on recovery returned to his unit in October. However, due to subsequently suffering acute trench nephritis and double pneumonia, he was invalided to Australia in May 1918. On 7 August, at Scots Church, Sydney, he married Sister May Isabel Bowman of the Australian Army Nursing Service who had nursed him during his illness.

Post-war

Post-war he held the rank of captain in the Militia. He established the business of Grieve, Gardner & Co., soft-goods warehousemen, in Flinders Lane, Melbourne, and was managing director until 4 October 1957 when he died of cardiac failure.

He was buried with military honours in Springvale cemetery. Grieve's medal was presented by his family to Wesley College in 1959, and has been lent to the Shrine of Remembrance, where it is on permanent display. Grieve was an active supporter of Wesley College for many years and contributed towards an annual scholarship.

A home room at Wesley College is named in his honour as well as a 'Grieve Way' a street in Wodonga, Victoria.

Family
A son, Robert Henderson ""Bob"" Grieve (30 November 1924 – 15 December 2006) was a noted artist and president of the Victorian branch of the Victorian branch of the Contemporary Art Society from 1967 to 1987.

Relation to John Grieve
A number of references including the 1997 edition of The Register of the Victoria Cross list Sergeant Major John Grieve VC (Crimea, 1854) and Captain Robert Cuthbert Grieve (Belgium, 1917) as great uncle and great nephew. This connection was suggested by an article in The Times on 29 May 1964. The article said John Grieve sent home £75 from the Crimea to Robert Grieve and that if Robert Grieve was his brother and also emigrated, then some relationship may be established between the Crimean VC and an Australian First World War VC, Robert Grieve. However, descendants of both Grieve families have been in contact with each other and have found that they are not great uncle and great nephew.

8,"Barcheria is a fungal genus in the family Agaricaceae. This is a monotypic genus, containing the single sequestrate (having underground fruiting bodies) species Barcheria willisiana, found in western Australia.

Taxonomy

The type material was collected from mallee woodlands near Norseman, Western Australia. The genus name Barcheria  honours Barbara Archer, ""an enthusiastic and versatile collector who has contributed much to the knowledge of the arid-land fungi of Western Australia"". The specific epithet willisiana acknowledges the Jim Willis family of Victoria.

Description

Fruit bodies of Barcheria are small, measuring  by . They have a fragile texture, lack a stipe, and have purplish-brown scales on the outer skin (peridium). The internal gleba changes colour from cream to pale after it is exposed to air. Spores are thick walled and smooth, roughly spherical to broadly ellipsoid, and hyaline (translucent) when mounted in water or dilute potassium hydroxide. They have dimensions of 10.5–16.5 by 8–12 µm. Basidia (spore-bearing cells) are two-spored and measure 28–39.5 by 5–10 µm; cystidia are rare. The hyphae lack clamp connections.

Other sequestrate fungi in the family Agaricaceae include Montagnea, Gyrophragmium, Longula, and Endoptychum. In contrast with these genera, Barcheria lacks a stipe, the gleba changes colour upon exposure, and its spores are hyaline.

Habitat and distribution

The fungus is known only from the type locality, where it was found fruiting from July to August in red clay loam at a roadside verge. Nearby vegetation included species of Eucalyptus, Allocasuarina, and Melaleuca.

The Rocca Ubaldinesca or Castle of the Ubaldini is a relatively small Renaissance-style castle located in the town of Sassocorvaro Auditore, province of Pesaro, region of Marche, Italy. The castle, located on a hill overlooking the river Foglia, is peculiar for it turtle-like layout.

History
The present structure was commissioned by Federico da Montefeltro, Duke of Urbino to his architect Francesco di Giorgio Martini: the castle was built as a compact brick and stone building with tall sloping walls. The fort passed on to Ottaviano degli Ubaldini della Carda, brother of Duke Federico. The heraldic symbols in the castle belong to Ottaviano. The castle then passed to the Doria family of Genoa, who after 1511, became counts of Sassocorvaro.

The Counts of Sassocorvo died out in 1626, and the territory entered the Papal States. In 1706 the property was granted to Giovanni Cristoforo Battelli, Archbishop of Amasia, librarian and counselor to Pope Clement XI Albani.

Monsignor Battelli restored the castle, rebuilding a chapel and created a library. To the latter have been added papers and volumes from the Archbishopric. In the late 19th-century, the interiors were refurbished, creating a large hall, theater, and the interiors were decorated in 1895 by Enrico Mancini in a neoclassical style.

During the Second World War, the castle was used by Pasquale Rotondi to hide many works being targeted for looting by the Fascist armies. 

The castle now serves as the museum of the commune and includes an early 16th-century altarpiece depicting the Madonna and Child with Saints Sebastian, Roch and Nicolò by Evangelista da Pian di Meleto as well as Baroque paintings. It contains designs and works by Enrico Mancini (1867-1913), who also decorated the 19th-century Teatrino built into what was once the main hall of the fort.

17,"is a side-scrolling hack-and-slash action game produced by Sega and originally released as an arcade game in 1989. It is the second and the final arcade game in the Shinobi series, following the original Shinobi itself. The player controls a ninja aided by an attack dog, who is fighting to save the city from a terrorist organization.

Shadow Dancer was the first game developed for the Sega System 18 arcade board hardware, and its generally well-received home versions were released for the Master System console and several home computer systems in 1991. A loose adaptation titled Shadow Dancer: The Secret of Shinobi was released exclusively for the Mega Drive/Genesis in 1990.

Gameplay
The play mechanics of Shadow Dancer are similar to these of the arcade version of the original Shinobi. The controls and almost all of the player's moves from the original Shinobi are present here as well.

The biggest change is the addition of a canine companion, Shadow, that follows the protagonist around. When the dog barks towards an enemy, the player can sic the dog on the enemy by pressing the attack button while crouching, allowing the player an opportunity to attack the enemy while it is being bitten by the dog. However, if the player takes too long to attack the bitten enemy or the enemy has a strong defense, then the dog will be hurt and turn into a harmless pup. The dog will then remain in pup form until the player acquires the next time bomb or finishes the stage.

The player's weapons consists of an unlimited supply of shuriken and a sword which is used when adjacent to an enemy. When the player collects half of the time bombs in each stage, stronger weapons are granted until the player finishes the stage or loses a life. The player can also use one of three random ninja magic (ninpo) techniques that will clear the entire screen of enemies. Normally, these techniques can only be used once per stage, but if the player continues the game by inserting more coins and pressing START, the protagonist restarts the stage with two units instead of one. Bonus points are awarded if the player completes the game without using shuriken or ninja magic.

There are four different missions, consisting of three stages for the first mission and four stages each for the remaining three. In the first few stages of each mission, the player must collect a certain amount of time bombs scattered throughout the stage in order to proceed to the goal. The final stage in each mission is a confrontation between him and one of four bosses: an armoured giant throwing energy balls, a weaponized tank engine, a woman armed with a shield/weapon device, and a female ninja using magic and a naginata (the dog does not appear during boss battles).

Between each mission, there is a bonus stage minigame seen from the character's perspective as he tosses shuriken at enemy ninjas dropping down from a building. The player is awarded an extra life after successfully completing the minigame.

Plot
The young ninja battles together with his faithful pet dog. In the center of the city, a group of terrorists are committing every imaginable atrocity known to man, including the planting of time bombs throughout the metropolis. Our youthful hero and his canine companion courageously set out to gather all the explosives placed by the evil gang and annihilate the syndicate that manipulates them.

The protagonist is never actually named in the original arcade version, although the various home versions gives him differing identities. The manual and packaging description for the Master System version identifies him as Takashi, although the attract sequence in this same version contradicts this by naming him Fuma. The manual for the home computer versions produced by U.S. Gold, claims that he is Joe Musashi himself, with one print ad for the game referencing Kato and Sauros (who were characters from the Genesis version).

Release
Following its debut as an arcade game in 1989, Shadow Dancer was released on various home computer formats in Europe in 1991. Versions released for the Amiga, Atari ST, Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC, and ZX Spectrum were published by U.S. Gold and developed by Images. Some of these versions were re-released as budget titles by Kixx in 1993.

The Master System port was released in 1991 exclusively in Europe and Brazil. Although this version bears the title Shadow Dancer: The Secret of Shinobi on the packaging (like the Genesis version released in the same year), it is actually based on the arcade version and is simply titled Shadow Dancer in-game. Most of the content from the arcade version was cut and the play mechanics were modified a bit. Missions now consists of a single side-scrolling stage and a boss encounter. The player's canine companion no longer follows them around, but can still be summoned to kill certain enemies from a distance. Collecting time bombs is now an optional task that the player can conduct while on their way to the goal. When the player gathers all five time bombs in each mission, they will gain an attack power-up for the next boss battle. This version also features bonus stage minigames after completing each mission. While the minigame played after the first and third missions is the same as in the arcade version, the one after the second mission is new: it requires the player to throw shurikens at enemies while both them and the protagonist are in free fall between skyscrapers, and, unlike the other minigame, is played in a third-person perspective.

Reception

In Japan, Game Machine listed it on their January 1, 1990 issue as being the fourth most-successful table arcade unit of the month.

Shadow Dancer was well-received by critics upon its release in arcades. Sean Kelly of Zero magazine said it was ""a pretty impressive"" ninja game with ""a massive dog/wolf animal thingy that turns into a puppy every time it gets a good kicking"" and that, despite being derivative of earlier ninja games (such as Shinobi and Dragon Ninja), it was ""good fun"" to play. GamePro praised the arcade game as ""a slick-looking ninja quest with excellent 3-D backgrounds, jumpin' animation, and top-notch audio.""

The home conversions were also well-received. Commodore Format awarded this ""wondefully playable"", ""highly polished and challenging game that no one can really afford to miss"" a score of 89% upon its Commodore 64 release, and the same score for its 1993 re-release, while Zzap!64 gave it 83%. Your Sinclair described the ZX Spectrum as an ""impressive arcade conversion"" and ""pretty blimming marvellous"" and CRASH called it ""is a good scrolly beat-'em-up with arcade adventure overtones"" that is ""fast, tough and, above all, playable"". Amiga Action awarded the Amiga version of Shadow Dancer a review score of 84% and ranked it as the 19th best action game on the system. RAZE gave the Amiga version of Shadow Dancer a score of 89%.

The One gave the Amiga version of Shadow Dancer an overall score of 80%, beginning their review by stating that ""if first impressions were anything to go by, then Shadow Dancer would score very highly indeed ... Unfortunately first impressions don't rate very highly and the early promise soon fades"". The One criticised the ""annoying"" lack of checkpoints in levels, and expresses that foreground sprites blend in with the game's backgrounds, ""thus making the action a touch confusing"". The One praised Shadow Dancer's graphics, calling it's backgrounds ""noteworthy"" and noting the game's large sprites as ""reminiscent"" of the arcade original, furthermore calling Shadow Dancer ""deep"" and ""colourful"". The One also praised the dog companion feature, stating that it ""adds a novel strategic twist"" to Shadow Dancer's gameplay.

On the other hand, Retro Gamer in 2010 declared it inferior to the Sega Mega Drive's 1990 release Shadow Dancer: The Secret of Shinobi, ""let down by surprisingly stodgy controls, uninspired level design, and a really frustrating difficulty level"". In contrast, Computer and Video Games considered the original Shadow Dancer arcade game to be superior to the Sega Mega Drive game Shadow Dancer: The Secret of Shinobi. The game sold around 300,000 copies.

23,"Varsham (Rains) is a 2014 Malayalam drama film written and directed by Ranjith Sankar. The film stars Mammootty and Asha Sarath in the main roles, T. G. Ravi as the antagonist, along with Mamta Mohandas, Govind Padmasoorya and Master Prajwal in major supporting roles. It features a film score and soundtrack by Bijibal. Varsham released worldwide on 6 November 2014. The film received generally positive reviews from critics.

Plot
The film narrates the story of Venu who is an affluent finance company owner but at the same time very much uses the usual croony tactics finance companies use to build their business. His world is limited to only his son and wife. Like any father he imposes his dreams and aspirations on his son without realizing the effect it is having on him.
One night, after an argument with Anand on giving a worker 10000 rupees for building  house, his son dies of a cardiac arrest and this leads him to see the world in a different perspective. Using his finance company, Venu starts using innovative loan schemes at interests rates lower than that of the market to help people with healthcare, education and other such needs, which leads to him making enemies of his rivals. How he copes up with all these issues and tries to keep his social work in the name of his son alive forms the crux of the story.

Reception
Varsham received generally positive reviews from critics, with praise towards the performances, direction and the screenplay.

Box office
The film was both commercial and critical success. The film collected 212 from 1st weekend at UK box office.

Critical reception
Nicy V.P of International Business Times gave the film 4.5/5 stars and wrote, ""Varsham is a movie worth investing your time and money. The USP of the movie is definitely the performance by the actors and the casting of the movie requires a special mention. Mammootty has carried the whole film on his shoulders with his impeccable perfection in acting."" IndiaGlitz concluded its review, ""Varsham is a very heart-touching tale with a very important message"" and gave the film a rating of 8.5 out of 10. Sreejith Naripatta of Indiavision gave the film 4 stars in a scale of 5 and wrote, ""Even though the narrative is told in a simple way, the audience is never allowed to be free from the mental tension"" and that it ""could be added to the list of the best family movies of Mammootty."" Akhila Menon of FilmiBeat also rated the film 4/5 and stated that Ranjith Sankar ""manages to bring up a very simple theme and portray it without any entertaining gimmicks or over-dosage of sentiments."" She concluded that the film was a ""tender and completely engrossing family drama.""

Padmakumar K of Malayala Manorama rated it 3.5 out of 5 and wrote, ""Many scenes are tearjerkers, but they lend an aura of substance as no other film in the immediate past has been able to. Sensibly orchestrated, these portrayals are captivating, deeply moving, rich and original."" He concluded that the film ""stands out as an exceptional work by Ranjith Sankar."" The Times of India gave the film 3.5 in a scale of 5 and concluded its review, ""Varsham has the elements of a thought-provoking film, which lingers even after you exit the movie hall."" The performances were praised as the reviewer noted, ""Asha Sarath's powerful portrayal deserves a special mention"", while also stating Mammootty's performance as ""soulful"". Jahangir Razzak of Mathrubhumi wrote that the film, ""is the most beautiful film of Ranjith Sankar"" and concluded, ""Varsham is a torrential downpour of goodness and the simplicity of appearance.""

Veeyen of Now Running rated it 3/5 and stated, ""Varsham is a soothing shower of compassion and goodwill that is undoubtedly Ranjith Sankar's best work as yet. It is a magnificently touching, tragic film that soaks you up in melancholy and optimism."" He lauded the performance of Mammootty and wrote, ""Mammootty lends his heart and soul to Venu, and comes up with a well rounded and emotionally raw performance that will, without doubt leave your eyes moist on several occasions"". The reviewer of Sify rated the film as ""Good"" and stated that the film was ""a rehashed version of those stereotyped movies from the past, but even then it has been presented well."" It also added, ""Mammootty makes the anguish of a father look disturbingly real"" and that ""for the fans of Mammootty, this one is nothing less than a grand treat."" Paresh C Palicha, writing for Rediff, commented, ""Varsham carries the stamp of Ranjith Sankar which is enhanced by Mammootty's presence."" He gave the film 3 out of 5 stars. Behindwoods also awarded the film 3/5 stars and stated, ""With stellar performances from the lead actors, the movie feels disturbingly real and leaves the audience in tears on several occasions.""

On the contrary, Raj Vikram of Metro Matinee wrote that the film ""holds no surprises and fails to fully tap the hidden potential in the subject"" and concluded, ""Varsham is akin to an impending rain, that never pours!"" E.V. Shibu of Mangalam lauded the performance of Mammootty as he noted, ""Mammootty amazes the audience just with his lip movement and makes them shed some tears"" and wrote that the film ""is full of moments that take advantage of the acting prowess of Mammootty"", but criticized the film as a whole, ""The visuals and characters that wander aimlessly in the second half, the slow pace and situations without any tightness make the 139-minute-long film a morose experience."" Sharika C. of The Hindu wrote, ""You know exactly where the film is going, and the only things that are added to the film at every turn, or lack of it, are more tears"" and stated that the film ""offers nothing new.""

Accolades
Varsham was ranked amongst the year-end top ten lists of International Business Times and Sify. Mammootty received the award for the best actor at the 17th Asianet Film Awards, 62nd Filmfare Awards South and 2014 Vanitha Film Awards for his portrayal of Venu.

25,"The story of the Rainbow Crow is a supposed Lenape legend, symbolizing the value of selflessness and service. However, the Lenape origins of this myth are denied by the Lenape-Nanticoke Museum, which attributes the myth to a recent modification of a Cherokee story known as the ""First Fire"". And in fact, the museum states that the crow has no significant role in traditional Lenape culture. No source for a Lenape version of this story is known to exist prior to a 1989 book of the same name supposedly ""retold"" by Penguin Random House author Nancy Van Laan. Nancy ultimately attributes this story to a Chief Bill ""Whippoorwill"" Thompson.

Plot
After a long period of cold weather, the animals of the community become worried. They decide to send a messenger to the Great Sky Spirit to ask for relief. The Rainbow Crow, the most beautifully feathered bird, offers to make the arduous journey. He travels safely, and is rewarded by the Great Spirit with the gift of fire. He carries the gift in his beak back to his people, but upon his return, he does not appear to be the same bird that he once was. The fire has scorched his plumage black, with only hints of his previous color, and his voice has been made rough and hoarse by the smoke. In this way, his sacrifice is commemorated.

Another name for Rainbow Crow is Many Colored Crow. This is in reference to the iridescent feathers created from the fire that scorched his plumage black, with only hints of his previous color that reflect when sun light strikes them.

Adaptations
This legend is the basis of multiple American animated short films, including one by online media platform HitRecord and another by Baobab Studios titled Crow: The Legend, with singer John Legend voicing the titular crow.

26,"The 1922–23 Torquay United F.C. season was Torquay United's second season in competitive football and their first season in the Southern League.  The season runs from 1 July 1922 to 30 June 1923.

Overview
After a creditable first season of competitive football in the Western League, Torquay United applied a second time to enter the Southern League and were this time successful. Naturally entering the English Section, the League consisted mainly of reserve teams from Football League sides, as well as a handful of other professional clubs such as Boscombe and their old Western League rivals Yeovil & Petters United.  Although Torquay made an inconsistent start to life in the Southern League, they soon picked up the pace as the season wore on.  Finishing strongly and losing just one of their last ten games, United ended the season in a respectable 6th place.

As the second highest placed non-reserve side, Torquay United now felt confident enough to apply for election to the Football League.  However, United's bid was unsuccessful and the club did not even receive a single vote in the ballot. Having failed in their attempt at election to the Third Division South, Torquay would have to settle for a second season in the Southern League although, due to restructuring, they would now be taking their place in the newly created Western Section.

He was born in 1908 to a privileged Hungarian family. As a young journalist, he reported on the rise of fascism in Europe and became a dedicated anti-Nazi. When the German army marched through Budapest in 1941, he fled the country under an assumed name, ending up first in Cairo and, after the war, in London. He returned to Budapest in February 1947, where he edited a magazine and joined the Communist Party. But he was soon arrested as a spy, and spent the next five years in prison. He was subjected to solitary confinement and torture. He was finally released in 1954, and after the Hungarian Uprising in 1956, he left the country for good.

Paloczi-Horvath settled in Richmond, London with his family, and earned his living as a freelance writer and journalist. He published The Undefeated in 1959; the book won the Atlantic Editors' Non-Fiction Prize and the Prix de la Liberté, and has been reprinted by Eland Books. He also wrote political biographies of Khrushchev and Mao Tse-tung.

He died of a heart attack in 1973.

29,"Voyage of the Scarlet Queen was a radio drama portraying the adventures of the 78-foot ketch Scarlet Queen in the South Pacific. It was broadcast on Mutual from 3 July 1947 to 14 February 1948.

Personnel
James Burton produced the scripts by Gil Doud and Robert Tallman. Elliott Lewis starred as Philip Karney, master of the Scarlet Queen, with Ed Max as first mate Red Gallagher.
Other voice actors include: Gloria Blondell, Lillian Buyeff, William Conrad, John Dehner, Verna Felton, Paul Frees, Frank Gerstle, Virginia Gregg, Ira Grossel, William_Johnstone_(actor), Berry Kroeger, Jack Kruschen, Mary Lansing, Cathy Lewis, Roddy McDowall, Alan Reed, Rolfe Sedan, Charles Seel, Eric Snowden, Ben Wright (English actor), and Barton Yarborough.
Sound effects were provided by Ray Kemper, Tom Hanley, Bill James, considered among the best in the business.
Music was composed and conducted by Richard Aurandt.

Scenario
Each episode opens with an entry from the ship's log, such as: ""Log entry, the ketch Scarlet Queen, Philip Karney, master. Position -- three degrees, seven minutes north, 104 degrees, two minutes east. Wind, fresh to moderate; sky, fair..."" with a similar closing: ""Ship secured for the night. Signed, Philip Karney, master."" Arriving at an exotic port of call, the captain and first mate would go ashore and immediately run into trouble with local authorities, agents of rival merchants, or desperate women in need of rescue. After some investigation and at least one good fight they would solve the problem, get back on the ship and sail away, Karney and Gallagher sharing a laugh and a drink at the wheel before the captain's closing log entry.

Principal Characters
Ship's Master Captain Philip Karney is a principled man of action who places mission above personal gain.
First Officer Red Gallagher is a skilled bo'sun and a loyal sidekick to Karney, although the loyalty is suspect for the first few episodes.
Ku Chei Kang, Karney's employer and the financier of the voyage of the Scarlet Queen, appears in only one episode, but figures prominently in episodes 1-21. Kang is the owner of the sprawling international ""China Traders, Kang and Sons"", offices of which are visited numerous times by Karney in those episodes.
Constantino, a Portuguese crime lord or similar stature villain, is Kang's antagonist and the source of many (but by no means all) of the troubles that befall Karney and the Scarlet Queen. Constantino's many agents appear in the first 20 episodes, but Constantino himself does not appear until episode 21.
Ah Sin is a remarkably obese, delicate, vain, educated and ruthless Chinese trader who speaks ""like Charles Laughton"" and surrounds himself with clouds of jasmine perfume. He appears in three episodes. Ah Sin has a sidekick, a Texan named Mangan who carried a pearl-handled frontier pistol. (Ah Sin was the name of an unrelated character in a Bret Harte poem and later a play by Harte and Mark Twain that attempted to expose American racist attitudes toward immigrant Chinese laborers in California. See The Heathen Chinee.)
Henrietta ""Hank"" Ainley is a love interest of Karney who appears in two episodes. She is acted by Cathy Lewis, real-life wife of Captain Karney actor Elliott Lewis.
Neilson is the crew member who is mentioned most by name and the only one with any speaking lines. He is voiced by Frank Driscoll in Episode 4 and by the famous William Conrad in episode 20. Other crew members mentioned in the action include Cronin, Gordon, and Kohler.

What Changed from the Pilot to the Series
The pilot starred Howard Duff as Captain Phil Karney, and Elliott Lewis as First Officer Red Gallagher. For the series, Lewis took the role of Karney and Ed Max was brought on to play Gallagher.
The pilot show mentions the ultimate villain as Van Gort; this becomes Constantino in the series. Other than a few edits to tighten up the script, The Death of David Malone (the pilot) is as effective as The Shanghai Secret (the first episode of the series) as an introduction to the drama.

Dramatic Basis and Story Arc
Episodes 1-20 chronicle the voyage from San Francisco through many meticulously detailed ports of call until they reach episode 20, ""Kang's Treasure and the Ghost of Tangolan Bay"". During this time Karney and Gallagher visit ports of call for resupply and further instructions from Kang, provided through local agents of Kang's sprawling Pacific trading operation. At nearly every step they are opposed by agents of Constantino. The ""$10 million"" prize is a set of ancient Chinese artifacts from every major period of Chinese history. Kang feels the artifacts will restore much needed pride to the people of devastated postwar China, while Constantino is simply greedy and knows that Kang will pay dearly for the artifacts. This climaxes at episode 21. 
After Episode 21, Karney, Gallagher, and the Scarlet Queen have another dozen or so adventures, but the series seems to run out of steam without the Kang-Constantino rivalry and the continuity of the original story.

The Scarlet Queen and the Starship Enterprise
The structure of the adventures, opening with a quote from the Ship's Log that introduces a sense of mystery of what is to come, and finishing with a final ""captain's log"" entry, with adventure in between, has been suggested as a forerunner to the much later Star Trek. The opportunities for inspiration are myriad, but they do not prove causation.

Spelling of the Captain's Name
Many old-time radio websites exist with reviews of the show and downloads of episodes. Captain Phil Karney's name is spelled variously as Carney, Karney, and Kearney. An image of a Billboard magazine review of the show from August 1947 uses Kearney.  However, the original scripts for ""The Barefoot Nymph in the Mother Hubbard Jacket"" and ""The Ninth Niece in the Street of Weeping Women"" use Karney. These scripts are in the UCLA library special collections Mort Fine collection boxes 51 and 52.

Individual Episodes
Voyage of the Scarlet Queen - Complete Log
Fictitious locations are in quotes. Modern Google Maps place names are in parentheses.

Assessment
Technically the show was among the better radio productions of the time, employing realistic sound effects and sailing terminology, well paced stories and colorfully detailed settings. Most places visited by the Queen are real. Even the map coordinates given by the captain are mostly accurate, following a zigzag course around the South Pacific.

Follow-ups
After the show was cancelled, an attempt was made to revive it under a different name.  Only the audition show was produced which was not picked up.  The new show's title was to be The Log Of The Black Parrot.  The cast included Ed Max, Ted Osborne, Lillian Buyeff, Harold Hughes, Jack Kruschen, and Ben Wright.  Music was directed by Walter Schumann and composed by Nathan Scott.  The audition was produced by the star of Scarlet Queen, Elliot Lewis and directed by Gil Doud.  The announcer was Bob Stevenson.  It was recorded on May 6, 1950.

A TV pilot was made in 1975 loosely based on the same concept, titled The Log of the Black Pearl, which likewise included Jack Kruschen in the cast, co-starring with Ralph Bellamy and Kiel Martin, with Jack Webb as executive producer.

31,"The Justified & Stripped Tour was a co-headlining concert tour by American recording artists Justin Timberlake and Christina Aguilera. It was launched in support of Timberlake's debut studio album, Justified (2002), and Aguilera's fourth studio album, Stripped (2002). Timberlake announced that he would go on a co-headlining tour at the 2003 American Music Awards, and it was officially announced that Aguilera would be the co-headlined artist of the tour on January 14, 2003. Tour dates were revealed on February 21, 2003; it kicked off on June 4, 2003 in Phoenix, Arizona and visited 45 cities in North America. The Black Eyed Peas were serviced as the tour's supporting act.

The set list was composed generally from Timberlake's Justified and Aguilera's Stripped. However, both artists also added material from their early works, including Timberlake's work with NSYNC and Aguilera's self-titled debut album; she also performed two of Etta James's songs: ""At Last"" and ""I Prefer You"". The Justified and Stripped Tour was divided into five segments, two for Aguilera and three for Timberlake, with each segment being followed by an interlude to the next segment, and it ended with an encore, lasting for a total of 160 minutes.

The tour was met with mixed reviews from most contemporary music critics. Some praised the maturities of the two artists, while others criticized their vocal abilities during the tour. They also believed that Aguilera's image during the tour resembled that of American recording artist Cher, and her part concentrated too much on her vocal abilities, while Timberlake's part worked his considerable sex appeal. However, the tour was a commercial success, garnering more than US$30 million and becoming the fifth-highest-grossing tour in 2003. It also became the third-highest-grossing co-headlining tour of the year. In late 2003, the tour's extension, The Stripped Tour was held to promote Aguilera's Stripped without Timberlake's act. An extended play, entitled Justin & Christina, was released exclusively at Target Stores to support the tour.

Development 
When she was asked why they decided to go on tour together, Aguilera replied, ""We both put out records around the same time that kind of introduced ourselves to the world as new artists, in a way. So it was just a good time. And I've known Justin since the Mickey Mouse Club days, since we were twelve or thirteen, so we go back in our friendship, and it kind of works.""

Concert synopsis

The concert began with the video introduction of ""Stripped Intro"", featuring Aguilera handcuffed, blindfolded and sitting in a chair as the words ""scandal"", ""gossip"" and ""lies"" flashed across the screen. Backed by a five-piece band and eight back-up dancers, Aguilera strutted out singing ""Dirrty"" and ""Get Mine, Get Yours"", with curly black hair, a black and ""hot-pink halter with belly-baring plunging neckline"", pants and spiked heels. She performed ""The Voice Within"" as the follow-up, with a long black dress. During the acoustic version of ""Come On Over Baby (All I Want Is You)"", she gave a speech, ""Thank you so much for coming ... I'm getting that feeling again and it's a blessing. Yes, I've grown up a little bit. Now I'm 22... I'm so happy you've grown with me"". Aguilera went onstage again, performing the ""Egyptian-turned-metal"" version ""Genie in a Bottle"", where she rolled on a giant ""X"" which portrayed her then newly established alter ego ""Xtina"". Wearing ""hot pink straps attached to her outfit"", she slowly unraveled herself as the ""genie"" in the song, provocatively dancing her way out of the bottle. The performance of ""Can't Hold Us Down"" featured a pink ""spark-shooting"" motorcycle. Then, she belted out ""Make Over"" with the ""rhythmic trot of a Spanish spaghetti Western"", featuring ""chain-link fence"".

Following the video interlude of ""Loving Me 4 Me"", she performed the ballad ""Impossible"". She later changed into a ""silky empire-waisted"" red dress to channel her favorite singer, Etta James, and performed two of James' hits, ""At Last"" and ""I Prefer You"". The rendition of ""Lady Marmalade"" from the soundtrack Moulin Rouge! was described as ""a playful romp"" between four male dancers dressed as sailors and four female members of the troupe in lingerie. During the medley of two Spanish songs from Mi Reflejo, ""Contigo en la Distancia"" and ""Falsas Esperanzas"", a male dancer ripped off the skirt she wore, revealing tiny denim boy-cut shorts underneath. Later, she ""saucily"" replied, ""Just because my album name is Stripped, doesn't mean you can take my clothes off"". She continued with the ""gorgeous ache"" of ""Walk Away"". The performance of ""Fighter"" ""had more feelings and excitements"", and the performance version of ""What a Girl Wants"" was provided with some ""well-deserved"" dance moves, in which she wore a purple shirt and shorts. Aguilera ended her part with ""Beautiful"", wearing jeans and a T-shirt which emblazoned with the words ""God sees no color"".

Timberlake's part began with a video interlude of ""Ghetto Blaster"", followed by the performance of ""Rock Your Body"". He yelled, ""Scream!"", ""What's up?"", ""We got some crazy people in the crowd tonight"", he responded. ""I'll be your host for this evening. I'm gonna test your knowledge a little bit with this one. Let's see if you can spot this one"".

Reception
The Justified and Stripped Tour garnered mixed reviews from contemporary critics. Longtime critic Robert Hilburn for the Los Angeles Times called Aguilera's part ""tedious"" and her stage persona ""uncertain"", while praising Timberlake's act, considering him ""born for the stage (with) the savvy instincts to put together a show that works. Rather than make himself the constant center of attention, he was comfortable enough at times simply to be part of a talented ensemble."" By contrast, the Orange County Registers Ben Wener complimented Aguilera's performance, writing ""I'd favor Aguilera's sex-appeal feast over Timberlake's club jam... Christina is simply a more well-rounded entertainer."" Meanwhile, he criticized Timberlake's part and compared him to George Michael. Darryl Morder from The Hollywood Reporter was not impressed with either artist, naming the tour ""more a case of egofied and cluttered."" Morder further said that Aguilera's numbers were ""too often swathed in bloated arrangements"", while Timberlake's voice was ""whiny and thin.""

Multiple critics also believed that Aguilera's image during the tour resembled Cher's look during the 1980s. Christina Fuoco from MTV News drew similarities between the two artists: big curly black locks, a black and hot-pink halter with belly-baring plunging neckline, pants, and spiked heels. Writing for the San Francisco Chronicle, Neva Chonin also compared Aguilera to Cher, with ""a torso-baring black ensemble, a shock of dark hair exploding from the back of her head"". In 2003, the tour was the sixteenth-highest-grossing tour of the year, with a total gross of US$30,261,670. 546,483 tickets were sold out of 592,360 available (approximately 92%), including 23 sellout shows out of 45 (approximately 51%). It was also the third-top-grossing co-headlining tour of the year, only behind Face to Face by Billy Joel and Elton John, and Rocksimus Maximus by Aerosmith and Kiss.

32,"Acanthocyte (from the Greek word ἄκανθα acantha, meaning 'thorn'), in biology and medicine, refers to an abnormal form of red blood cell that has a spiked cell membrane, due to thorny projections. A similar term is spur cells. Often they may be confused with echinocytes or schistocytes.

Acanthocytes have coarse, weirdly spaced, variably sized crenations, resembling many-pointed stars. They are seen on blood films in, among others abetalipoproteinemia, liver disease, chorea acanthocytosis, McLeod syndrome, and several inherited neurological and other disorders, such as neuroacanthocytosis, anorexia nervosa, infantile pyknocytosis, hypothyroidism, idiopathic neonatal hepatitis, alcoholism, congestive splenomegaly, Zieve syndrome, and chronic granulomatous disease.

Usage
Spur cells may refer synonymously to acanthocytes, or may refer in some sources to a specific subset of 'extreme acanthocytes' that have undergone splenic modification whereby additional cell membrane loss has blunted the spicules and the cells have become spherocytic ('spheroacanthocyte'), as seen in some patients with severe liver disease.

Acanthocytosis can refer generally to the presence of this type of crenated red blood cell, such as may be found in severe cirrhosis or pancreatitis, but can refer specifically to abetalipoproteinemia, a clinical condition with acanthocytic red blood cells, neurologic problems and steatorrhea. This particular cause of acanthocytosis (also known as abetalipoproteinemia, apolipoprotein B deficiency, and Bassen-Kornzweig syndrome) is a rare, genetically inherited, autosomal recessive condition due to the inability to fully digest dietary fats in the intestines as a result of various mutations of the microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTTP) gene.

Pathophysiology

Acanthocytes arise from either alterations in membrane lipids or structural proteins. Alterations in membrane lipids are seen in abetalipoproteinemia and liver dysfunction. Alteration in membrane structural proteins are seen in neuroacanthocytosis and McLeod syndrome.

In liver dysfunction, apolipoprotein A-II deficient lipoprotein accumulates in plasma causing increased cholesterol in RBCs. This causes abnormalities of membrane of RBC causing remodeling in spleen and formation of acanthocytes.

In abetalipoproteinemia, there is deficiency of lipids and vitamin E causing abnormal morphology of RBCs.

Differential diagnoses

The diagnosis of acanthocytosis should be differentiated from:
acute or chronic anemia, hepatitis A, B, and C, hepatorenal syndrome, hypopituitarism, malabsorption syndromes, and malnutrition.

Acanthocytosis secondary to malnourishment, such as anorexia nervosa and cystic fibrosis, remits with resolution of the nutritional deficiency. Acanthocyte-like cells may be found in hypothyroidism, after splenectomy, and in myelodysplasia.

Acanthocytes should be distinguished from echinocytes, which are also called 'burr cells', which although crenated are dissimilar in that they have multiple, small, projecting spiculations at regular intervals on the cell membrane. Burr cells usually imply uremia, but are seen in many conditions, including mild hemolysis in hypomagnesemia and hypophosphatemia, hemolytic anemia in long-distance runners, and pyruvate kinase deficiency. Burr cells can also arise in vitro due to elevated pH, blood storage, ATP depletion, calcium accumulation, and contact with glass.  Acanthocytes should also be distinguished from keratocytes, also called 'horn cells' which have a few very large protuberances.

38,"Medial pulvinar nucleus (nucleus pulvinaris medialis) is one of four traditionally anatomically distinguished nuclei of the pulvinar of the thalamus. The other three nuclei of the pulvinar are called lateral, inferior and anterior pulvinar nuclei.

Connections

Afferent  
 Medial pulvinar nucleus, together with its lateral and inferior nuclei, receives afferent input from superior colliculus.
 Medial pulvinar nucleus also receives many afferent inputs from different cortical areas, including cingulate, posterior parietal, premotor and prefrontal cortical areas. This is the pattern of input connections typical for association relay nuclei of the thalamus.

Efferent 
 Medial pulvinar nucleus sends its widespread projections to the different areas of association cortex, including cingulate, posterior parietal, premotor and prefrontal cortical areas. This is the pattern of output connections typical for association relay nuclei of the thalamus.

Functions 
 Medial pulvinar nucleus, together with its lateral and inferior nuclei, is thought to be important for the initiation and compensation of saccadic movements of the eyes. Those nuclei also participate in the visual attention regulation.
 Medial pulvinar nucleus is also thought to participate in the process of integration and association of information received from different sensory modalities (multisensory or multimodal integration), and also in the process of integration and coordination of sensor input and its corresponding motor response (sensorimotor integration).

Clinical significance
Lesions of the medial pulvinar nucleus can result in neglect syndromes and attentional deficits while preserved connectivity to the medial pulvinar has been implicated in blindsight abilities.

43,"Mark Zachares is a Republican politician and lobbyist who served as Congressional aide to Rep. Don Young (R-AK).  He pleaded guilty on April 24, 2007 to accepting tens of thousands of dollars in gifts from lobbyist Jack Abramoff in return for using his position in Congress to advance Abramoff's interests.

Career
Zachares became acquainted with Jack Abramoff while serving as Secretary of the Department of Labor and Immigration for the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (""the CNMI""); Abramoff was a lobbyist for business interests of the U.S. territory. The Anchorage Daily News described their relationship:

Abramoff was the commonwealth's lobbyist. According to the Saipan Tribune, he was paid at least $11 million from 1994 to 2001 to prevent Congress from interfering with local regulation of wage rates and immigration - the two issues under Zachares' authority. ""Beginning in the mid-1990s, Zachares came to have extensive contact with Abramoff during Zachares' tenure as an official of the CNMI, and Zachares and Abramoff became personal and professional acquaintances"", the charging document said.

Zachares received $10,000 from Abramoff's false charity, Capital Athletic Foundation in two payments. The first came while he was secretary, the second after leaving the job. Starting after the 2000 election and a number of months afterwards, Abramoff attempted to convince the White House to hire Mark Zachares as the head of the Interior Department's Office of Insular Affairs. In 2002, Abramoff helped Zachares secure a job as legal counsel to the Oversight & Investigations subcommittee of the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, then became staff director for the Coast Guard & Maritime subcommittee—both overseen by Rep. Don Young, who served on the committee that oversees insular affairs, the House Resources Committee.

It was alleged that

While doing favors for Abramoff from his positions on Young's committee, Zachares was rewarded with all kinds of favors, from being invited on a $160,000 golf trip to Scotland to use of Abramoff's luxury box seats at the MCI Center in Washington where the Wizards of the NBA and Capitals of the NHL play, $30,000 worth of sporting and event tickets from Abramoff, free meals and drinks at Signatures Restaurant, and free rounds of golf at Woodmore Country Club, where Abramoff was a member.

Zachares, as part of his plea bargain, agreed to cooperate with federal prosecutors, who, in exchange, would not prosecute Zachares' wife, Cynthia.

The scandal was portrayed in the 2010 movie Casino Jack and the United States of Money.

44,"The nif genes are genes encoding enzymes involved in the fixation of atmospheric nitrogen into a form of nitrogen available to living organisms. The primary enzyme encoded by the nif genes is the nitrogenase complex which is in charge of converting atmospheric nitrogen (N2) to other nitrogen forms such as ammonia which the organism can use for various purposes. Besides the nitrogenase enzyme, the nif genes also encode a number of regulatory proteins involved in nitrogen fixation. The nif genes are found in both free-living nitrogen-fixing bacteria and in symbiotic bacteria associated with various plants. The expression of the nif genes is induced as a response to low concentrations of fixed nitrogen and oxygen concentrations (the low oxygen concentrations are actively maintained in the root environment of host plants). The first Rhizobium genes for nitrogen fixation (nif) and for nodulation (nod) were cloned in the early 1980s by Gary Ruvkun and Sharon R. Long in Frederick M. Ausubel's laboratory.

Regulation 
In most bacteria, regulation of nif genes transcription is done by the nitrogen sensitive NifA protein. When there isn't enough fixed nitrogen available for the organism's use, NtrC triggers NifA expression, and NifA activates the rest of the nif genes. If there is a sufficient amount of reduced nitrogen or oxygen is present, another protein is activated: NifL. NifL inhibits NifA activity resulting in the inhibition of nitrogenase formation. NifL is regulated by the products of glnD and glnK. The nif genes can be found on bacterial chromosomes, but in symbiotic bacteria they are often found on plasmids or symbiosis islands with other genes related to nitrogen fixation (such as the nod genes).

Examples in nature 

The expression and regulation of nif genes, while sharing common features in all or most of the nitrogen-fixing organisms in nature, have distinct characters and qualities that differ from one diazotroph to another. Examples of nif gene structure and regulation in different diazotrophs include:

Klebsiella pneumoniae—a free-living anaerobic nitrogen-fixing bacterium. It contains a total of 20 nif genes located on the chromosome in a 24-Kb region. nifH, nifD, and nifK encode the nitrogenase subunits, while nifE, nifN, nifU, nifS, nifV, nifW, nifX, nifB, and nifQ encode proteins involved the assembly and incorporation of iron and molybdenum atoms into the nitrogenase subunits. nifF and nifJ encode proteins related to electron transfer taking place in the reduction process and nifA and nifL are regulatory proteins in charge of regulating the expression of the other nif genes.
 
Rhodospirillum rubrum—a free-living anaerobic photosynthetic bacterium which, in addition to the transcriptional controls described above, regulates expression of the nif genes also in a metabolic way through a reversible ADP-ribosylation of a specific arginine residue in the nitrogenase complex. The ribosylation takes place when reduced nitrogen is present and it causes a barrier in the electron transfer flow and thereby inactivates nitrogenase activity. The enzymes catalyzing the ribosylation are called DraG and DraT.

Rhodobacter capsulatus—a free-living anaerobic phototroph containing a transcriptional nif gene regulatory system. R. capsulatus regulates nif gene expression through nifA in the same manner described before, but it uses a different nifA activator which initiates the NtrC. NtrC activates a different expression of nifA and the other nif genes.

Rhizobium spp.—Gram-negative, symbiotic nitrogen fixing bacteria that usually form a symbiotic relationship with legume species. In some rhizobia, the nif genes are located on plasmids called 'sym plasmids' (sym = symbiosis) which contain genes related to nitrogen fixation and metabolism, while the chromosomes contain most of the housekeeping genes of the bacteria. Regulation of the nif genes is at the transcriptional level and is dependent on colonization of the plant host.

48,"(""The Lieutenant of Kouta"") is a 1979 novel by Malian author Massa Makan Diabaté. Loosely based on the author's hometown of Kita, Mali, the novel tells the story of a recently returned lieutenant from the French Colonial Army, Siriman Keita, and his struggle to adjust to his village's changing customs. It is the first book in Diabaté's ""Kouta trilogy,"" followed by  (""The Barber of Kouta,"" 1980) and  (""The Butcher of Kouta,"" 1982), which feature many of the same characters.

Plot 
Lieutenant Siriman Keita has returned from a long service in the French Colonial Army (during which he was awarded the Croix de guerre) to Kouta, a market village near his smaller home village of Kouroula. In Kouta, he at first plots to ascend to the canton chiefdom while avoiding his envious older brother, Faganda. However, his plans are scrapped when he humiliates himself in a horse-riding accident before the village, and he withdraws to his fortress-like ""square house."" After a time, he adopts a fatherless boy who he had once punished for stealing, and marries Awa, a Senegalese woman of questionable reputation. Disaster strikes the lieutenant again, however, when the French commandant incites him to lead a punitive expedition against the pro-independence village of Woudi. When the expedition fails, the lieutenant is stripped and humiliated before the people of Kouta and, after the commandant denies his own involvement, is sent to jail in the country's capital for disturbing the peace. He returns to find Awa pregnant by a young pro-independence activist, but having changed during his incarceration, the lieutenant forgives her betrayal and adopts the coming child as his own. He reconciles with the imam of the local mosque, formerly a bitter enemy, and eventually becomes the village muezzin, only to die mysteriously following an injection by his envious brother. The imam does him the honor of burying him in the mosque, while the French administrators, concerned by the example of his conversion, hastily and posthumously award him the Legion of Honour.

According to Mamadou Sangaré, the character of Siriman Keita was inspired by the real-life figure of Mamadou Keita, a Colonial Army lieutenant who retired to Kita. Though many incidents of the novel, such as the punitive expedition to Woudi, are entirely of Diabaté's creation, Mamadou Keita did finish his life by converting to Islam shortly before his death in 1959.

Criticism 
The novels of Kouta trilogy are often named as Diabaté's finest works. The Encyclopedia of African Literatures for example, praises the novels' ""colorful humor and . . . style worthy of a griot.""

Cheick M. Chérif Keïta sees the novel as representative of the tension between fadenya—the pull of innovation—and fasiya—the pull of tradition—in Diabaté's work. In this reading, Siriman Keita is both oppressed by tradition in the form of his aggressive (and likely homicidal) brother, but also resents the changes that the youth-led independence movement are bringing to his country. Ultimately, however, the lieutenant comes to see that tradition ""is not a monolith, but rather an edifice of which the fissures must always furnish an outlet for the creative energies of individuals and young innovators.""

The novel itself can be read as a blending of traditions, joining the proverbs and customs of Maninka culture to the European form of the novel. As Diabaté himself commented to one interviewer, ""J'essaie de donner à mon français, qui n'est pas le français de France, une coloration africaine, en y mêlant des proverbes, des récits et surtout en faisant, comme je l'ai toujours dit, ""quelques petits bâtards à la langue française"" (""I try to give my French, which isn't the French of France, an African coloring, mixing in proverbs, stories, and above all in making, as I always say, 'some little bastards of the French language'"").

J.R. McGuire reads a similar tension in the Kouta trilogy, though using the terms fadenya and badenya. Austen argues that in this respect, the novels are highly influenced by Diabaté's early writings on the similarly structured Epic of Sundiata, which he calls ""an inescapable intertext"" for works from Maninke culture.

50,"We Are Church is a movement that advocates changing the teachings and the structures of responsibility and authority of the Catholic Church. It originated in German-speaking Austria, Germany and South Tyrol in 1995 under the title Wir sind Kirche and was organized as an international association in 1996.

It has described Hans Küng as the spiritual father of initiatives that led to the founding of We Are Church.

Organization 

The association is composed of groups in various countries and does not accept individual members. A list of its national Media Contacts, with e-mail addresses and in some cases telephone numbers, is given on its website.

Objectives 

The movement adopted in 1997 a manifesto that made five demands:
The building of a Church of brothers and sisters that recognizes the equality of all the baptized, including the inclusion of the People of God in the election of bishops in their local churches.
Equal rights for men and women, including the admission of women to all Church ministries.
Free choice of either a celibate or married life for all those who dedicate themselves to the service of the church.
A positive attitude toward sexuality, and a recognition of personal conscience in decision -making.
A message of joy and not condemnation, including dialogue, freedom of speech and thought. No anathemas and no exclusion as a means of solving problems, especially as this applies to theologians.

Initiatives 

In 2006, the German association published 79 theses of different authors, which included ""God is not almighty"", ""Jesus Christ should not be seen as 'Lord'"", ""Mary was not a virgin at the birth of Jesus"", and ""The 'holy catholic church' is neither holy not catholic"".

On 4 June 2008, in response to a decree of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith that declared subject to an excommunication whose lifting was reserved to the Holy See anyone who attempted to confer holy orders on a woman, the international movement issued a statement under the heading, ""Jesus Christ did not ordain men or women to the ministerial priesthood but to care for and nurture each other as brothers and sisters"". In July of the same year, it congratulated the ""Anglican Church"" for its intention to consecrate women as bishops and declared its regret at ""the unchristian attitude of the Vatican establishment which, once again, usurping its mission, has come out in criticism of our Anglican brothers and sisters over the decision"".

In 2017  the association supported blessing of same-sex marriages.

Excommunication of a foundress 
On 22 March 2014, the Tiroler Tageszeitung published an interview with Martha Heizer, chairperson and co-founder of the international movement, and her husband, in which they stated that they had been informed that, in line with canon 1378 §2, they were excommunicated on account of their priestless ""private Eucharistic celebrations"".

53,"Splicing factor 3B subunit 2 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the SF3B2 gene.

Function 

This gene encodes subunit 2 of the splicing factor 3b protein complex. Splicing factor 3b, together with splicing factor 3a and a 12S RNA unit, forms the U2 small nuclear ribonucleoproteins complex (U2 snRNP). The splicing factor 3b/3a complex binds pre-mRNA upstream of the intron's branch site in a sequence-independent manner and may anchor the U2 snRNP to the pre-mRNA. Splicing factor 3b is also a component of the minor U12-type spliceosome. Subunit 2 associates with pre-mRNA upstream of the branch site at the anchoring site. Subunit 2 also interacts directly with subunit 4 of the splicing factor 3b complex. Subunit 2 is a highly hydrophilic protein with a proline-rich N-terminus and a glutamate-rich stretch in the C-terminus.

Interactions 

SF3B2 has been shown to interact with SF3B4, RBM7, SF3B1 and CDC5L.

56,"Arnold Henry Wagner (September 9, 1878 – September 9, 1949) was a musicologist and linguist who helped pioneer the improvement of voice and musical vibrato and advanced the theory of the psychology of music. He developed techniques to correct bad vibrato in singers' voices and in string and woodwind instruments, which was previously thought impossible. Over four decades he taught music and foreign singing language at the University of Southern California.

Personal life 

Wagner was the son of William Henry Wagner, a farmer and American Civil War veteran, and Harriet Parmelia Arnold. He was the youngest of seven children born in Lisbon, St. Lawrence County, New York, and raised in nearby Ogdensburg. His father conducted local choruses and community singing events and greatly influenced the young Arnold.

Arnold Wagner married Pearl Carlotta Comer, a concert pianist and the daughter of Levi Calvin Comer and Hattie Sheets, on June 28, 1915, in Los Angeles, CA. The couple had no children.

Education 

Wagner attended rural schools and at the Odgensburg Grammar School and Free Academy. He earned his lifetime teaching certificate at the State Normal and Training School in Potsdam, New York. In 1904, he traveled to Europe to study the French, German and Italian languages. He returned to the United States in 1906. By 1911, he resumed his education in Los Angeles. In 1919, he earned a Bachelor's of Arts degree at the University of Southern California (USC) and a Master's Degree in 1924 in music. He continued his studies at the Teachers College at Columbia University in 1925-1926. He spent summers from 1924 to 1928 at the State University of Iowa where he received his doctorate degree in music.

Career 

With his Potsdam Normal School teaching credentials, he began his career as a teacher in 1900 in Adirondack, New York. However, he quickly accepted a position offered by the United States government to teach English and music in the Philippines. He was part of the first batch of 100 students in 1901 to go overseas to teach English, music and art. He initially taught in the provinces before moving to Manila.

He returned to the United States in 1904 and became a music supervisor for the public school systems in Douglas and Bisbee, Arizona.

Returning to Los Angeles in 1911, Wagner taught at local schools before joining the Santa Monica Unified School District in 1913 to teach music and language. He later became head of the music department. Meanwhile, he taught music during the summers at USC and at the University of California, Berkeley, from 1921 to 1924, and at the University of California, Los Angeles, in 1925. By the mid-1920s he was a permanent professor at USC, teaching English, French, German, Italian and Spanish as it applied to singing. He also directed the university's glee clubs and directed choruses in addition to teaching courses in music appreciation and mentoring new teachers.

In the 1930s, he collaborated on two important voice and music projects. He conducted a series of experiments with Dr. Joel Pressman at Cedars of Lebanon Hospital in Los Angeles on vocal registration. Pressman had an expertise in the larynx and developed a technique to film the larynx working.

Among his findings, particularly in his collaboration with Pressman, Wagner found that vocal artists must pay close attention to refining their vibrato during performances and learn to control to increase or diminish the vibrato rate and the extent of oscillation. By exercising conscious control singers can modulate the rate if it becomes too slow or too fast, or the oscillation becomes inappropriate to the emotion of the performance. To establish that control, Wagner argued that vocalists, whether a child or adult, must pay attention to the action the musculature of the larynx that will lead to correct habits of control. Repetition and practice can lead to successful command of the vibrato. Many vocal artists, with the rise of radio and motion picture musical performances in the 1920s and 1930s, had difficulty with pitch. Wagner's study, ""An Experimental Study in Control of the Vocal Vibrato,"" provided singers with a path to exercise control over oscillation and pitch.

Wagner also conducted research with Dr. Carl E. Seashore, a prominent psychologist and educator, at the State University of Iowa where they studied the vibrato in the voice and its application to string and woodwind instruments. The focus was to remedy bad vocal vibrato. The research resulted in Seashore's book, ""Studies in the Psychology of Music, Vol. 1,"" in which Wagner contributed the chapter ""Remedial and Artistic Development of the Vibrato.""

When military veterans returned from overseas following World War II, they sought a university education, but were impatient with the stilted rules of teaching grammar and language. Wagner streamlined courses with his own teaching method of “Grammar Rules in Rime.”

Death 

Wagner died in 1949 at the age of 71 in Los Angeles. His widow, Pearl Comer Wagner, died in 1966, also in Los Angeles.

The wingspan is about 7 mm.

The larvae feed on Toxicodendron pubescens and Toxicodendron radicans. They mine the leaves of their host plant. The mine has the form of a flat, whitish blotch mine on the upperside of the leaf. Often, two or more mines occur on a single leaf, so that, by the completion of larval development, almost the entire surface of the leaf is mined.

58,"Constance Bache (; 11 March 1846 – 28/30 June 1903) was an English composer, pianist, teacher, translator, and biographer.

Early life and education
Constance Bache was born at Fairview House, Hagley Road, Edgbaston, 11 March 1846. She was the daughter of Samuel Bache (1804–1876), a Unitarian minister at the Church of the Messiah, Birmingham. She was the sister of Francis Edward Bache and Walter Bache; an uncle on her mother's side was James Martineau. In addition to studying under her brother Walter, and with James Stimpson, of Birmingham, she studied at the Munich Conservatorium and subsequently under Karl Klindworth and Frits Hartvigson.

Career
After an injury to her right hand, Bache gave up public performance excepting occasional Birmingham concerts. In 1883, she moved to London, where she took up teaching and literary musical work. Bache was very successful as a translator from German into English. Among her achievements, mention is made of the librettos of Franz Liszt's 'St. Elizabeth,' Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's 'Bastian and Bastienne,' Engelbert Humperdinck's ' Hansel und Gretel,' Robert Schumann's 'The Rose's Pilgrimage,' and Scenes from Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's ' Faust', as well as Liszt's 'Letters'; Heintz's analyses of Richard Wagner's works; Johann Christian Lobe's' Catechism of Music'; Hans von Bülow's annotations of Cramer, Frédéric Chopin. She wrote a biography of her two brothers, Brother Musicians: Reminiscences of Edward and Walter Bache, which was published in 1901.

She lectured on ""Modern Russian composers"", and one of the last acts of her busy life was to write an ""appreciation"" of her old friend, Alfred James Hipkins, in the columns of the July issue of the Monthly Musical Record. After being ill for five days, she died at Montreux, on 28 June 1903, age 57.

59,"John Le Boutillier or John Le Bouthillier (1797 – July 31, 1872) was a Quebec businessman and political figure.

He was born in Jersey in 1797 and came to the Gaspé peninsula around 1815 as an employee of Charles Robin. In 1830, he opened his own business exporting dried cod from the Gaspé region and settled in Gaspé. He represented Gaspé in the Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada from 1833 to 1838 and then Bonaventure from 1844 to 1847 and Gaspé from 1854 to 1867 in the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada. Le Boutillier voted against the Ninety-Two Resolutions. In 1867, he was named to the Legislative Council of Quebec for the Gulf division and served until his death in Gaspé in 1872.

His firm, which had grown to 2,500 employees, 12 ships and 169 fishing boats, was taken over by Charles Robin's company after his death.

Le Boutillier's final house in Gaspé was later a hospital before being razed in the 1970s against the wishes of preservationists. Another house formerly used by John Le Boutillier Company managers was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1975.

62,"Triatoma infestans, commonly called winchuka or vinchuca in Argentina, Bolivia, Uruguay and Chile, barbeiro in Brazil, chipo in Venezuela and also known as ""kissing bug"" or ""barber bug"" in English, is a blood-sucking bug (like virtually all the members of its subfamily Triatominae) and the most important vector of   Trypanosoma cruzi which can lead to Chagas disease. It is widespread in the Southern Cone countries of South America. This region has joined the control intervention called Southern Cone Initiative managed by the PAHO.

During the Beagle survey voyage, Charles Darwin noted in his journal for 26 March 1835 having ""experienced an attack, & it deserves no less a name, of the Benchuca, the great black bug of the Pampas. It is most disgusting to feel soft wingless insects, about an inch long, crawling over ones body; before sucking they are quite thin, but afterwards round & bloated with blood, & in this state they are easily squashed."" Richard Keynes describes this Benchuca as being Triatoma infestans.

Distribution
T. infestans has both a wide range of habitats/ecologies and geographic areas it inhabits - the former being the reason for the latter.

Ecological distribution
In South America T. infestans is almost an exclusively domestic species, especially as a household pest in the Cochabamba Valley in Bolivia and parts of Paraguay and Argentina.

There remain a few freeliving populations in Argentina, Paraguay, and Brazil.

Tends to displace other Triatominae vectors of Chagas including Panstrongylus megistus, T. sordida, T. brasiliensis, and T. pseudomaculata.

Geographical distribution
Brazil (only widespread from 1955-1964, likely by immigrants from the south to Pernambuco, likely continuing to be spread by internal migration), El Salvador, Venezuela, Peru (anthropic transportation), Argentina (especially as a household pest in some areas), Paraguay (especially as a household pest in some areas).

Biology

Defecation
Defecation is central to the T. cruzi transmission cycle of Triatomines. There is no direct transmission by feeding, instead deposition of parasites is associated with a bloodmeal but occurs solely by defecation. Trumper and Gorla 1991 find transmission to be inversely correlated with vector density: Crowded areas tend to have T. infestans interrupting each other, and interrupted feedings do not provide as much as a completed bloodmeal. T. infestans is unlikely to defecate when not sated and so rarely transmits. Low vector density areas therefore have high rates of transmission.

63,"Benno Griebert (1909 - 2000) was a German art historian and art dealer, and an early member of the Nazi party.

During the Third Reich 
A member of the Nazi party from before 1933, Griebert worked as an advisor for the Reich Chamber of Fine Arts in Berlin from 1934 to 1937. At the Reich Chamber of Fine Arts, his role was to ensure that art exhibitions respected Nazi ideology.  In 1938-1939 he advised the Berlin National Gallery  He also worked with the Nazi looting organisation known as the E.R.R. (Einsatzstab Reichsleiter Rosenberg) and had ties to convicted Nazi art looter Bruno Lohse who stayed with the Griebert's after Lohse's release from prison in 1950.

Benno Griebert's son, Peter, became close to Lohse. When Nazi looted art was discovered in the vault of Lohse's Foundation Schonart, the only person authorized to access it was reportedly the younger Grieber.

Benno Griebert was, along with Fritz Nathan, a key dealer for the controversial art collector Emil Bührle.

Postwar activities 
After the Second World War, Benno Griebert initially worked as an art dealer in Constance from 1950; from 1958 he continued to run Alexander Gebhardt's  Galerie für alte und neue Kunst  (Gallery for Old and New Art) in Munich, which was dissolved in the same year.

Research projects about Benno Griebert 
Numerous artworks that passed through Benno Griebert are currently listed on the German Lost Art Foundation's website.

Benno Griebert and his Meersburg Gallery in Lake Constance have been the object of research projects to identify the networks of art dealers trading in Nazi looted art after the war. From 4 May 2018 - 3 February 2019 an exhibition entitled ""The Obligation of Ownership: An art collection under scrutiny - Provenance Research at the Friedrichshafen Museum"" was devoted to ""exploring post-war dealers' networks through whom the German museum acquired many works in its collection whose provenances were far from clean. Benno Griebert and his Meersburg Gallery in Lake Constance were a major source, which also involved Bruno Lohse, Adolf Weinmüller, Herbert Hoffmann and others.""

The Aarguar Kunsthaus also undertook provenance research, notably into Griebert's sales to the art collectors Othmar und Valerie Häuptli, noting that ""he was probably involved in the Nazi art looting in the territories occupied by the German Wehrmacht"".

Restitutions of Nazi-looted art 

In 2011 the Landesmuseum Württemberg in Stuttgart, Germany restituted a 16th-century wooden sculpture of St. John the Baptist to the heirs of Jacob and Rosa Oppenheimer, who had been plundered by the Nazis because Jewish. The Jean Paul Getty Museum which acquired the artwork after it was restituted, noted in the provenance that Nazis had auctioned the looted sculpture to Heinemann and Dr. B. Griesbert, after which it disappeared into anonymous private collections before arriving at the Landesmuseum Württenberg.

66,"Andi LaVine Arnovitz (born 1959) is an American-Israeli printmaker and multimedia artist.

Work 
Arnovitz is an activist/feminist artist who works in a variety of media. Her primary source of inspiration is paper, she considers herself a paper-manipulator, a bookmaker and an assemblage artist. Her pieces often reflect her affinity for pattern, surface, and thread, a passion she developed as a child wandering through her father’s fabric store in Kansas City.

Her focus is the flashpoint where gender, politics and religion meet. Of great concern to her are primary issues surrounding the differences between Jews and Arabs, between religious and non-religious, between Jewish law and contemporary society, between men and women, between young and old. Over and over these politics and tensions are explored, examined and dissected in her works. She is a self-described feminist artist who subverts traditionally feminine materials, using them to create awareness, protest, dialogue, and disapproval.

Life
Arnovitz was born in 1959, in Kansas City, Missouri. She graduated from Washington University in St. Louis with a Bachelor's in Fine Arts. She credits the conceptual ideas behind many of her pieces to her experience working in advertising as an art director, creating print campaigns and television commercials.

She is married David Arnovitz, and they have five children. In 1999, Andi and her family moved to Jerusalem, Israel. A two year sabbatical became a permanent stay, and much of her work is informed by the multitudinous differences of living in the Middle East. She previously worked at the Jerusalem Print Workshop in Israel .

Exhibitions 
Her work appeared at the Stern Gallery, Shulamit Gallery, and the Jerusalem Biennale.

Her work has appeared in the following museums:
The Jewish Museum Berlin, Germany
The Museum of Art Haifa, Israel
The Herman Struck Museum, Haifa
HUC Museum, New York, NY
 The Eretz Israel Museum, Tel Aviv, Israel
 Hebrew Union College Museum NYC
The Museum of Biblical Art NYC

68,"""The Last Sam Weiss"" is the penultimate episode of the third season of the Fox science fiction television series Fringe, and the 64th episode overall. The storyline follows the continuing disintegration of the prime universe, as the Fringe team races to prevent the destruction of their world. FBI agent Olivia Dunham recruits Sam Weiss for help while Peter recovers from touching the doomsday machine in the previous episode.

Executive producers Monica Owusu-Breen and Alison Schapker co-wrote the episode, and cinematographer Thomas Yatsko directed. ""The Last Sam Weiss"" is meant to be the middle of an ""epic trilogy,"" as the season finale aired the following week. Guest actors Kevin Corrigan and Ryan McDonald returned as Weiss and Brandon Fayette, respectively.

On its initial broadcast on April 29, 2011 in the United States, an estimated 3.49 million viewers tuned in. More viewers in America time shifted the episode than watched it live, leading to a 67 percent increase in the 18–49 demographic. This was the highest increase on any network for that week. While the episode received generally positive reviews, television critics were divided about the ending, with some comparing it to the television series Lost.

Plot
In the prime universe, the doomsday machine creates numerous static lightning storms along the eastern seaboard. As Walter and Astrid see to Peter's recovery after his failed attempt to enter the machine, Olivia takes Sam Weiss to the machine. Weiss states that the machine is not meant to be a doomsday device and that the strange effects are a byproduct of the machine's ""frustration"" due to its believing that Peter is already inside the machine. Weiss suggests finding a proverbial ""crowbar"" that can be used to break the shield protecting the device to give Peter enough time to enter it. As Olivia travels with Weiss to collect a box and the key containing this crowbar, Weiss explains that he descends from a long unbroken line of men named Sam Weiss whose forebear found the incomplete collection of information on the First People and the device, and have sought to try to find the rest. Upon collecting both the box and key, they open it to find a parchment, revealing that Olivia herself is the crowbar.

Meanwhile, Walter and Astrid determine that most of the effects of the device are occurring in the areas between western Massachusetts and Liberty Island—the locations of the doomsday machines in the prime and parallel universes respectively—aligned like iron filings around the ends of a magnet. Walter convinces Broyles to move the device to Liberty Island to reduce the area affected by the strange events. During this time, Peter wakes with confused memories and leaves the hospital, traveling to a location in New York City and buying a silver dollar coin from a pawn shop.

Olivia and Weiss bring the parchment to Walter, who recognizes that Olivia's telekinetic powers must be used to turn off the machine in the parallel universe. To prepare Olivia, they use the quantum entangled Selectric typewriter that the shapeshifters had used to contact the parallel universe. Olivia struggles unsuccessfully with trying to activate the typewriter, even with Walter's support. Peter is soon discovered in New York, about the same time that the machine has been moved into position. Walter and Olivia rejoin him, finding him confused and believing himself to be in the parallel universe. Peter eventually comes to his senses, with Walter believing his confusion to be a temporary result of the head trauma. Astrid calls the trio from the lab, revealing that the typewriter is typing out ""Be a better man than your father"", a phrase that Olivia and Peter have talked about before, thus giving them hope that Olivia will be able to disengage the parallel universe's device. After she does so, Peter takes a moment to recall the events of his life, including his experiences with Walter and Olivia, and then steps into the machine.

Peter wakes up wounded on a chaotic street in downtown New York City. He finds himself in unfamiliar territory, facing a plaque dedicated in 2021 to the victims of the September 11 attacks, and is quickly assisted by an officer of the militarized Fringe division.

Production
The episode was co-written by co-executive producers Monica Owusu-Breen and Alison Schapker, while being directed by cinematographer Thomas Yatsko. ""The Last Sam Weiss"" was the second-to-last episode of the season. Though the season 3 finale was scheduled to be just an hour long, executive producer Jeff Pinkner confirmed that the last three episodes would be ""linked in one continuous story arc"". This was a reflection of Pinkner and co-executive producer J.H. Wyman's intent to have the last three episodes of every season seem like ""you're turning the last page of a chapter in a novel. And usually in a good novel, the last pages [of a chapter] compels you forward with a new understanding of what the subject matter is and you get deeper and you can’t wait to turn that page."" Some media outlets have referred to the episodes as a ""three-part third-season finale"".

Actor John Noble called the beginning scene with Olivia and Walter naked ""the funniest thing"" yet, explaining ""The writers keep throwing challenges at me, because I never say no. They said, 'Okay, John, you’ll do a scene naked.' I said 'Okay.' And so that was a big surprise. So I do this scene, this strange scene with Anna Torv, without any clothes on. Anna’s staying at the Bishop house with Walter running around with no clothes on except for a pair of slippers, getting breakfast. She comes round the corner and catches him in the full monty, going, 'Oh no!' Didn’t know where to look. That was probably one of the most fun things we ever did. Anna’s reaction was priceless to that. I haven’t seen the scene yet, but it was hilarious to do it.""

In March 2011, TVLine's Michael Ausiello exclusively confirmed that previous guest actor Kevin Corrigan would be returning for the twentieth and twenty-first episodes of the season. Corrigan last appeared in the season's twelfth episode ""Concentrate and Ask Again""; his role in ""The Last Sam Weiss"" marked his seventh appearance on Fringe. The actor expressed appreciation that his character's name was used in the title, but was disappointed it alluded to his final appearance in the show to date. The episode is Corrigan's last credit on the series, though he previously stated his interest in returning as one of his ancestors or as a doppelganger.

As with other Fringe episodes, Fox released a science lesson plan in collaboration with Science Olympiad for grade school children, focusing on the science seen in ""The Last Sam Weiss"", with the intention of having ""students learn about static electricity and how it is created and dissipated.""

Reception

Ratings
On its first broadcast in the United States on April 29, 2011, the episode was watched by an estimated 3.49 million viewers and scored a 1.3 ratings share among adults 18–49. More viewers time shifted the episode than watched it live, as its ratings increased 67 percent in the 18–49 demographic, resulting in a 2.0 rating; this was the largest increase out of every other television series airing that week.

Reviews

""The Last Sam Weiss"" received generally positive reviews from television critics. Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly called the episode ""equally surprising in its plotting and pacing"", praised Sam and Olivia's scenes together, and believed the ending to be ""mind-blowing"" and ""both startling and thrilling"". The A.V. Club's Noel Murray graded the episode with an A-, writing the first half ""wasn't quite as rollicking as last week's episode, because there was a lot more set-up and explanation required to keep the story moving"" but ""then the second half brought in all the emotion and tension, topped off by an unexpected gut-punch of an ending."" Murray admitted his ""eyes glazed over a bit"" during the search for the ""crowbar"", believing it to be ""little too Lost-y"", but ""the quirky Corrigan as Weiss helped put all the mumbo-jumbo over"".

SFScope columnist Sarah Stegall agreed with Murray's Lost comparison, writing that the ending of the episode was ""right out of the Lost playbook, a little too on the nose for my liking."" Stegall did however call it a ""good bridge episode, taking us from the setup of last week to the denouement next week, when it all comes together."" IGN writer Ramsey Isler was more positive about the final sequence, explaining that the ""last five minutes of this story changed everything, and made me excited about the series again."" While praising the special effects, he also noted his displeasure that Sam Weiss ""ends up not being as mystical or magical as previous stories hinted"". Isler wished Corrigan had more screen time in the episode, calling it ""under-utilization of a great character the writers have spent a lot of time building up."" He rated it 7.5/10, an indication of a ""good"" episode, but criticized its ""slow"" pacing.

While Isler was pleased that Olivia appeared on the drawing, Stegall expressed skepticism that this revelation ""smacks too much of manipulation, which would render our heroes' actions and sacrifices meaningless."" TV.com staff highlighted ""The Last Sam Weiss"" as one of the best television episodes of the 2010–11 United States network television schedule.

72,"Johnny Parker (6 November 1929 – 11 June 2010) was a British jazz pianist.

Early life 
Parker was born in Beckenham, Kent, England. In 1940, his family moved to Wiltshire, where Parker was exposed to American Forces Network broadcasts, and first heard boogie-woogie piano at a US Air Force base.  Parker returned to Beckenham after the Second World War and worked a paper round to be able to buy records by pianists such as Pete Johnson and Albert Ammons.

Career 
While in Beckenham, Parker regularly cycled the  Bexleyheath to watch George Webb's Dixielanders perform. Around this time, he joined the Catford Rhythm Club and played at regular sessions. He became the resident pianist, performing at the club until 1948, when he was called up for National Service. He served with the Royal Army Ordnance Corps as an ammunitions examiner, while accompanying jazz musicians such as Beryl Bryden and Mike Daniels.

After his period in the armed forces, Parker enrolled at Regent Street Polytechnic, and – from 1950 to 1951 – played in Mick Mulligan's band. Later in 1951 Parker joined the band of Humphrey Lyttelton and was the pianist on the trumpeter's 1956 hit record ""Bad Penny Blues"". Parker's piano riff has been cited as similar to (and a possible influence on) Paul McCartney's piano playing on ""Lady Madonna"". He stayed with Lyttleton for six years, performing with Sidney Bechet and supporting Louis Armstrong and Eddie Condon. In 1965 Parker appeared with the Lyttelton band in a televised programme featuring American blues shouter Big Joe Turner.

After a failed attempt to start his own band, Parker took a position inspecting components at an aircraft assembly plant.  He continued playing in jazz bands alongside artists such as Alexis Korner, Diz Disley, Cyril Davies, and Long John Baldry. Parker worked on-and-off in inspection until early 1969, when he joined Kenny Ball's Jazzmen. Parker underwent a spinal operation in December that year, but recovered within months and returned to regular touring.

He performed with Ball until 1978. Subsequently, Parker led his own jazz groups around London and toured the Middle East. He retired in 2005, citing long-term health problems. He died on 11 June 2010.

Personal life 
Parker was married twice. He had four children – two (Rebecca and Robert) from his marriage to Maureen Wallis, and two (Abigail and Beverly) from his marriage to South African singer Peggy Phango. Phango, who was the first cousin of Miriam Makeba, died in 1998.

73,"In condensed matter physics, a spin glass is a  magnetic state characterized by randomness, besides cooperative behavior in freezing of spins at a temperature called 'freezing temperature' Tf.  Magnetic spins are, roughly speaking, the orientation of the north and south magnetic poles in three-dimensional space.  In ferromagnetic solids, component atoms' magnetic spins all align in the same direction.  Spin glass when contrasted with a ferromagnet is defined as ""disordered"" magnetic state in which  spins are  aligned randomly or not with a regular pattern and the couplings too are random.

The term ""glass"" comes from an analogy between the magnetic disorder in a spin glass and the positional disorder of a conventional, chemical glass, e.g., a window glass.  In window glass or any amorphous solid the atomic bond structure is highly irregular; in contrast, a crystal has a uniform pattern of atomic bonds.  In ferromagnetic solids, magnetic spins all align in the same direction; this is analogous to a crystal's lattice-based structure.

The individual atomic bonds in a spin glass are a mixture of roughly equal numbers of ferromagnetic bonds (where neighbors have the same orientation) and antiferromagnetic bonds (where neighbors have exactly the opposite orientation: north and south poles are flipped 180 degrees).  These patterns of aligned and misaligned atomic magnets create what are known as frustrated interactions – distortions in the geometry of atomic bonds compared to what would be seen in a regular, fully aligned solid.  They may also create situations where more than one geometric arrangement of atoms is stable.

Spin glasses and the complex internal structures that arise within them are termed ""metastable"" because they are ""stuck"" in stable configurations other than the lowest-energy configuration (which would be aligned and ferromagnetic).  The mathematical complexity of these structures is difficult but fruitful to study experimentally or in simulations; with applications to physics, chemistry, materials science and artificial neural networks in computer science.

Magnetic behavior
It is the time dependence which distinguishes spin glasses from other magnetic systems.

Above the spin glass transition temperature, Tc, the spin glass exhibits typical magnetic behaviour (such as paramagnetism).

If a magnetic field is applied as the sample is cooled to the transition temperature, magnetization of the sample increases as described by the Curie law. Upon reaching Tc, the sample becomes a spin glass and further cooling results in little change in magnetization. This is referred to as the field-cooled magnetization.

When the external magnetic field is removed, the magnetization of the spin glass falls rapidly to a lower value known as the remanent magnetization.

Magnetization then decays slowly as it approaches zero (or some small fraction of the original value—this remains unknown). This decay is non-exponential and no simple function can fit the curve of magnetization versus time adequately. This slow decay is particular to spin glasses. Experimental measurements on the order of days have shown continual changes above the noise level of instrumentation.

Spin glasses differ from ferromagnetic materials by the fact that after the external magnetic field is removed from a ferromagnetic substance, the magnetization remains indefinitely at the remanent value. Paramagnetic materials differ from spin glasses by the fact that, after the external magnetic field is removed, the magnetization rapidly falls to zero, with no remanent magnetization. The decay is rapid and exponential.

If the sample is cooled below Tc in the absence of an external magnetic field and a magnetic field is applied after the transition to the spin glass phase, there is a rapid initial increase to a value called the zero-field-cooled magnetization. A slow upward drift then occurs toward the field-cooled magnetization.

Surprisingly, the sum of the two complicated functions of time (the zero-field-cooled and remanent magnetizations) is a constant, namely the field-cooled value, and thus both share identical functional forms with time, at least in the limit of very small external fields.

Edwards–Anderson model
In this model, we have spins arranged on a -dimensional lattice with only nearest neighbor interactions similar to the Ising model. This model can be solved exactly for the critical temperatures and a glassy phase is observed to exist at low temperatures. The Hamiltonian for this spin system is given by:

 

where  refers to the Pauli spin matrix for the spin-half particle at lattice point , and the sum over  refers to summing over neighboring lattice points  and . A negative value of  denotes an antiferromagnetic type interaction between spins at points  and . The sum runs over all nearest neighbor positions on a lattice, of any dimension. The variables  representing the magnetic nature of the spin-spin interactions are called bond or link variables.

In order to determine the partition function for this system, one needs to average the free energy  where , over all possible values of . The distribution of values of  is taken to be a Gaussian with a mean  and a variance :

 

Solving for the free energy using the replica method, below a certain temperature, a new magnetic phase called the spin glass phase (or glassy phase) of the system is found to exist which is characterized by a vanishing magnetization  along with a non-vanishing value of the two point correlation function between spins at the same lattice point but at two different replicas:

 

where  are replica indices. The order parameter for the ferromagnetic to spin glass phase transition is therefore , and that for paramagnetic to spin glass is again . Hence the new set of order parameters describing the three magnetic phases consists of both  and .

Under the assumption of replica symmetry, the mean-field free energy is given by the expression:

Sherrington–Kirkpatrick model
In addition to unusual experimental properties, spin glasses are the subject of extensive theoretical and computational investigations. A substantial part of early theoretical work on spin glasses dealt with a form of mean-field theory based on a set of replicas of the partition function of the system.

An important, exactly solvable model of a spin glass was introduced by David Sherrington and Scott Kirkpatrick in 1975. It is an Ising model with long range frustrated ferro- as well as antiferromagnetic couplings. It corresponds to a mean-field approximation of spin glasses describing the slow dynamics of the magnetization and the complex non-ergodic equilibrium state.

Unlike the Edwards–Anderson (EA) model, in the system though only two-spin interactions are considered, the range of each interaction can be potentially infinite (of the order of the size of the lattice). Therefore, we see that any two spins can be linked with a ferromagnetic or an antiferromagnetic bond and the distribution of these is given exactly as in the case of Edwards–Anderson model. The Hamiltonian for SK model is very similar to the EA model:

 

where  have same meanings as in the EA model. The equilibrium solution of the model, after some initial attempts by Sherrington, Kirkpatrick and others, was found by Giorgio Parisi in 1979 with the replica method. The subsequent work of interpretation of the Parisi solution—by M. Mezard, G. Parisi, M.A. Virasoro and many others—revealed the complex nature of a glassy low temperature phase characterized by ergodicity breaking, ultrametricity and non-selfaverageness. Further developments led to the creation of the cavity method, which allowed study of the low temperature phase without replicas. A rigorous proof of the Parisi solution has been provided in the work of Francesco Guerra and Michel Talagrand.

The formalism of replica mean-field theory has also been applied in the study of neural networks, where it has enabled calculations of properties such as the storage capacity of simple neural network architectures without requiring a training algorithm (such as backpropagation) to be designed or implemented.

More realistic spin glass models with short range frustrated interactions and disorder, like the Gaussian model where the couplings between neighboring spins follow a Gaussian distribution, have been studied extensively as well, especially using Monte Carlo simulations. These models display spin glass phases bordered by sharp phase transitions.

Besides its relevance in condensed matter physics, spin glass theory has acquired a strongly interdisciplinary character, with applications to neural network theory, computer science, theoretical biology, econophysics etc.

Infinite-range model
The infinite-range model is a generalization of the Sherrington–Kirkpatrick model where we not only consider two spin interactions but -spin interactions, where  and  is the total number of spins. Unlike the Edwards–Anderson model, similar to the SK model, the interaction range is still infinite. The Hamiltonian for this model is described by:

 

where  have similar meanings as in the EA model. The  limit of this model is known as the random energy model. In this limit, it can be seen that the probability of the spin glass existing in a particular state, depends only on the energy of that state and not on the individual spin configurations in it.
A gaussian distribution of magnetic bonds across the lattice is assumed usually to solve this model. Any other distribution is expected to give the same result, as a consequence of the central limit theorem. The gaussian distribution function, with mean  and variance , is given as:

 

The order parameters for this system are given by the magnetization  and the two point spin correlation between spins at the same site , in two different replicas, which are the same as for the SK model. This infinite range model can be solved explicitly for the free energy in terms of  and , under the assumption of replica symmetry as well as 1-Replica Symmetry Breaking.

Non-ergodic behavior and applications
A thermodynamic system is ergodic when, given any (equilibrium) instance of the system, it eventually visits every other possible (equilibrium) state (of the same energy). One characteristic of spin glass systems is that, below the freezing temperature , instances are trapped in a ""non-ergodic"" set of states: the system may fluctuate between several states, but cannot transition to other states of equivalent energy. Intuitively, one can say that the system cannot escape from deep minima of the hierarchically disordered energy landscape; the distances between minima are given by an ultrametric, with tall energy barriers between minima. The participation ratio counts the number of states that are accessible from a given instance, that is, the number of states that participate in the ground state. The ergodic aspect of spin glass was instrumental in the awarding of half the 2021 Nobel Prize in Physics to Giorgio Parisi.

For physical systems, such as dilute manganese in copper, the freezing temperature is typically as low as 30 kelvins (−240 °C), and so the spin-glass magnetism appears to be practically without applications in daily life. The non-ergodic states and rugged energy landscapes are, however, quite useful in understanding the behavior of certain neural networks, including Hopfield networks, as well as many problems in computer science optimization and genetics.

Self-induced spin glass

In 2020, physics researchers at Radboud University and Uppsala University announced they had observed a behavior known as self-induced spin glass in the atomic structure of neodymium.  One of the researchers explained, ""...we are specialists in scanning tunneling microscopy. It allows us to see the structure of individual atoms, and we can resolve the north and south poles of the atoms. With this advancement in high-precision imaging, we were able to discover the behavior in neodymium, because we could resolve the incredibly small changes in the magnetic structure.""  Neodymium behaves in a complex magnetic way that had not been seen before in a periodic table element.

History of the field

A detailed account of the history of spin glasses from the early 1960s to the late 1980s can be found in a series of popular articles by Philip W. Anderson in Physics Today.

74,"There are at least three passages that refer to non-heterosexual sexual intercourse in the New Testament (NT), all of which are found in the Pauline epistles: Romans , 1 Corinthians , and 1 Timothy . A fourth passage, found in Jude , is often interpreted as referring to homosexuality. In the synoptic Gospels, Jesus discusses marriage only in a heterosexual context when he cites the Book of Genesis during a discussion of marriage (Mark  and Matthew ).

The references to homosexuality itself in the New Testament hinge on the interpretation of three specific Koine Greek terms:  (),  (), and  () along with its cognates. While it is not disputed that the three Greek words apply to sexual relations between men (and possibly between women), some academics interpret the relevant passages as a prohibition against pederasty or prostitution rather than homosexuality per se, while some scholars hold the historical position that these passages forbid all same sex sexual acts and relationships.

Homosexuality in Gospel of Matthew
In 1984, gay historian Joseph Wallfield, writing under the pen name Warren Johansson, revived a 1922 proposal by German philologist Friedrich Schulthess, that ""racha"" of Matthew 5:22 should be equated with the Hebrew , meaning ""soft"" or ""weak"", a ""weakling"" or ""effeminate person.""
In the King James Version of the Bible, the text reads:

As a hapax legomenon, the translators of King James had left ""raca"" uninterpreted; this remained true at the time of Schulthess' writing. However, the interpretation of ""raca"" as sexually connoted received support with the 1934 publication of an ancient Egyptian papyrus written in Greek in 257 BC, which contained the word ""rachas"".

Johansson further suggested that the Greek word , translated above as ""fool,"" refers to a male aggressor. As in Genesis 19:4-6, the allusion to punishment makes this interpretation more plausible. As stated by New York University Sociology Professor David F. Greenberg, ""It is tempting to infer that Jesus' denunciation of those who speak abusively to others about their homosexual practices, unaccompanied by any condemnation of the practices themselves, implies a defense of those who engage in them. This would [however] go considerably beyond the text...."".

This passage would be the only direct commentary by Jesus on homosexuality.

Homosexuality in the Pauline epistles

Romans 1:26-27

Epistle to the Romans 1:26–27 (English Majority Text Version, EMTV):

The context is Paul's mission to the gentiles, the gospel being ""to the Jew first, and also to the Greek"" (1:16), followed by a description of pagan idolatry in verses 1:21–25. The phrase ""passions of dishonor"" (KJV: ""vile affections"") translates ,
  meaning ""dishonour, ignominy, disgrace"".
In the expressions ""natural use"" and ""contrary to nature"", ""nature"" translates , i.e. Physis. The term ""error"" translates ,  (lit. ""straying, wandering"").

The authenticity of the passage is in doubt; scholars and theologians have proposed its being part of a larger non-Pauline interpolation. Furthermore, many contend 1:18-32 represents not Paul's own position but his summary of Hellenistic Jewish legalism. Calvin Porter, for example, concludes that ""in 2:1-16, as well as through Romans as a whole, Paul, as part of his gentile mission, challenges, argues against, and refutes both the content of the discourse [of 1.18-32] and the practice of using such discourses. If that is the case then the ideas in Rom. 1.18-32 are not Paul's. They are ideas which obstruct Paul's gentile mission theology and practice.""

Natural law
The authors of the New Testament had their roots in the Jewish tradition, which is commonly interpreted as prohibiting homosexuality. A more conservative biblical interpretation contends ""the most authentic reading of [Romans] 1:26-27 is that which sees it prohibiting homosexual activity in the most general of terms, rather than in respect of more culturally and historically specific forms of such activity"".

Several early church writers state that Romans 1:26b is a condemnation of men having unnatural sex with women. Underlying Paul's thinking is Genesis 2:22-24, ""The Lord God then built the rib that he had taken from the man into a woman. When he brought her to the man, the man said: ""This one, at last, is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; ...That is why a man leaves his father and mother and clings to his wife, and the two of them become one body."" For Paul, God's intended order is for male and female sexual relationships, united in marriage. That is what he saw as natural, and therefore same sex relationships were unnatural. In 1 Romans, Paul is giving examples of what happens when people abandon God's plan.

The passage has been described by David Hilborn of the Evangelical Alliance as ""the most important biblical reference for the homosexuality debate"". In common with many traditional commentators, Hilborn goes on to argue that condemnation of homosexual activity is derived from the ""broad contours"" of Paul's argument, in addition to the selective reading of individual words or phrases.

Yale University professor John Boswell (1980) speculated that the text does not condemn ""homosexual acts by homosexuals"", but rather ""homosexual acts committed by heterosexual persons"". Boswell argues that the conceptual modality (natural laws) which would provide the basis for the condemnation of homosexuality did not exist prior to the Enlightenment era. Hays argues that Romans 1:26-27 is part of a general condemnation of humans, in which males and females, have rejected their creational (as in Genesis) distinctions, with homoeroticism being intrinsically wrong.

John J. McNeill (1993) also invokes ""heterosexuals"" who ""abandoned heterosexuality"" or ""exchanged heterosexuality for homosexuality"". Joe Dallas (1996), opposing what he saw as ""pro-gay theology"" behind such interpretations, contended that the apostle Paul is condemning changing ""the natural use into that which is against nature"" (Romans 1:26-27), and to suggest that Paul is referring to ""heterosexuals indulging in homosexual behavior requires unreasonable mental gymnastics"".

Idolatrous practices
Jeramy Townsley goes on to specify the context of Romans 1:26-27 as the continuation of Paul's condemnation of the worship of pagan gods from earlier in the chapter, linking the 'homosexuality' implied in Romans 1:27 to the practice of temple prostitution with castrated priests of Cybele, practices condemned more explicitly in the Old Testament (1 Kings 15:12, 2 Kings 23:7), the same religious group that violently attacked Paul in Ephesus, driving him from the city (Acts 19). The implication is that the goddess religions, the castrated priests and temple prostitution had a wide impact in ancient Mediterranean culture so would immediately evoke an image for the 1st-century audience of non-Yahwistic religious idolatry, practices not familiar to the modern reader, which makes it easy to misinterpret these verses. On the other hand, Brooten notes that Clement of Alexandria likely interpreted Romans 1:27 as a condemnation of lesbians. Mona West argues that Paul is condemning specific types of homosexual activity (such as temple prostitution or pederasty) rather than a broader interpretation. West argues that Paul is speaking to a gentile audience, in terms that they would understand, to show that ""all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God"" (Romans 3:23).

1 Corinthians 6:9-10

The phrase ""abusers of themselves with mankind"" translates , also rendered ""sodomites"" (YLT), or ""men who have sex with men"" (NIV). Paul's use of the word in 1 Corinthians is the earliest example of the term; its only other usage is in a similar list of wrongdoers given (possibly by the same author) in 1 Timothy 1:8–11. The term rendered as ""effeminate"" is , with a literal meaning of ""soft"". Nowhere else in scripture is malakos used to describe a person.

These verses are a continuation of Paul's berating the Christians at Corinth for suing one another before pagan judges in Roman courts, which he sees as an infringement upon the holiness of the Christian community. Paul lists a catalogue of typical vices that exclude a person from the kingdom of God, specifically vices that the church members either practiced and would still be practicing but for the fact they were now Christians, with the express intention of showing church members that they ought to be able to settle minor disputes within the community, and above all, deal with each other charitably.

1 Timothy 1:9-10

The term relevant to homosexuality, ""that defile themselves with mankind"", translates  (), the same term for homosexuals used in 1 Corinthians. Other translations of the term include: ""them that do lechery with men"" (Wycliffe 1382), ""those practicing homosexuality"" (NIV), ""those who abuse themselves with men"" (Amplified Version, 1987).

Since the 19th century, many scholars have suggested that First Timothy, along with Second Timothy and Titus, are not original to Paul, but rather an unknown Christian writing some time in the late-1st to mid-2nd century. Most scholars now affirm this view.

Jude 1:7

The expression of ""giving themselves over to fornication"" translates , , rendered as ""sexual immorality"" in both NIV and ESV; the phrase ""going after strange flesh"" is a literal translation of , rendered as ""perversion"" in NIV and as ""pursued unnatural desire"" in ESV. However, scholarly debate remains open whether the transgression of Sodom and Gomorrah is rooted in homosexual actions or consistent with Genesis stories regarding Abraham's hospitality to strangers (see ).

Simon J. Kistemaker notes that the Greek phrase  (, ""strange flesh"") is often interpreted as the specific desire on the part of the Sodomites to have sexual relations with angels.
Kistemaker, however, argues that it means they were ""interested in sexual relations with men.""

Jesus' discussion of marriage
In Matthew 19:3, Jesus is asked ""Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any cause?"" He answered that:

Rob Gagnon, an associate professor of New Testament studies, argues it is ""obvious"" that Jesus' back-to-back references to Genesis 1 and Genesis 2 show that he ""presupposed a two-sex requirement for marriage"" even though the question he was being asked was about a contemporary dispute about whether married couples could divorce.

Leroy Huizenga, a Catholic theology professor, acknowledges the question's origin in a dispute between rabbis as to whether divorce was permissible for adultery, for ""many"" reasons, or for ""any reason, including 'even if he find one fairer than she'"", and claims Jesus' reply as meaning that Genesis trumps Moses allowing divorce in Deuteronomy. Huizenga argues that Jesus' reference to Genesis is ""likely"" to include the command in Genesis 1:28 to ""Be fruitful and multiply"". Thus for him, Jesus is affirming that marriage is a union meant to be fruitful, ideally to result in children. Huizenga says Jesus' teaching about marriage here does modify the position held by his Jewish contemporaries, but in drawing on the creation accounts it is ""more radical and less permissive"".

Interestingly, still in response to the question in Matthew 19:3, Jesus speaks further and discusses a class he calls 'eunuchs', which would seem to be a reference to something more than simply those who have removed their testicles or external genitalia (or had them removed) or been born without such:

Words with disputed or ambiguous meanings

The Greek word  appears in 1 Corinthians 6:9 and 1 Timothy 1:10. In 1 Corinthians 6:9-10, Paul says:

The word translated as ""practicing homosexuals"" has been alternately rendered as ""abusers of themselves with mankind"" (King James Version, 21st Century King James Version), ""sodomites"" (Young's Literal Translation), or ""homosexuals"" (New American Standard Bible), ""men who practice homosexuality"" (English Standard Version), ""those who abuse themselves with men"" (Amplified Bible), ""for those who have a twisted view of sex"" (New International Readers Version), ""for sexual perverts"" (Good News Translation), ""for abusers of themselves with men"" (American Standard Version) or, in German and several other Northern European languages, as ""pederasts."" The original term is unknown before it appears in Paul's writings.  (), meaning ""a male who lies down with a male"" (,  ""male""; , , ""bed""), rather than the normal terms from the Greek culture. Within the Bible, it only occurs in this passage and in a similar list in 1 Timothy 1:9-10.

The term is thought to be either a Jewish coinage from the Greek (Septuagint) translation of Leviticus 20:13, or even Paul's own coinage:

Arguments against a reference to homosexual behaviour
In contrast, John Boswell argues that this is a term specifically created by Paul, and that given its unusual nature, the fact that Paul did not use one of the more common pagan Greek terms, and given its direct reference to the Levitical laws, it is a matter of debate whether Paul was referring generally to any person having homosexual sex, or whether it referred only to anal sex of any form (cf. Elliott 2004). Other translations of the word, based on examinations of the context of its subsequent uses, include Dale B. Martin's (1996), who argued it meant ""homosexual slave trader"", and Boswell's (1980) who argued it referred to ""homosexual rape"" or homosexual prostitutes. Like Martin Luther, Scroggs perceives it as referring to exploitative pederasty.

The term  was rarely used in Church writings (Elliott 1994), with Townsley (2003) counting a total of 73 references. Most are ambiguous in nature, although St. John Chrysostom, in the 4th century, seems to use the term  to refer to pederasty common in the Greco-Roman culture of the time, and Patriarch John IV of Constantinople in the 6th century used it to refer to anal sex: ""some men even commit the sin of  with their wives"" (Townsley 2003). Moreover, Hippolytus of Rome in his Refutation of all Heresies describes a Gnostic teaching, according to which an evil angel Naas committed adultery with Eve and  with Adam. The context suggests the translation of  as pederasty, although it might have a different meaning.

John Boswell argues that  in 1 Corinthians 6:9 and 1 Timothy 1:10 refers specifically to male prostitution.

In his 2006 book Sex and the Single Savior, Dale B. Martin discusses examples of the word's usage outside of Paul's writings and argues that ""no one knows"" what it meant but that ""It is certainly possible, I think probable, that  referred to a particular role of exploiting others by means of sex, perhaps but not necessarily by homosexual sex.""

Arguments for a reference to homosexual behaviour
Some scholars argue the word is more against the restriction of the word to pederasty. For example, Scobie states that ""there is no evidence that the term was restricted to pederasty; beyond doubt, the NT here repeats the Leviticus condemnation of all same-sex relations"". Similarly, Campbell writes, ""it must be pointed out, first, that  is a broad term that cannot be confined to specific instances of homosexual activity such as male prostitution or pederasty. This is in keeping with the term's Old Testament background where lying with a 'male' (a very general term) is proscribed, relating to every kind of male-male intercourse."" Campbell (quoting from Wenham) goes on to say that, ""in fact, the Old Testament bans every type of homosexual intercourse, not just male prostitution or intercourse with youths.""

Others have pointed out that the meaning of  is identified by its derivation from the Greek translation of the Old Testament, where the component words ""with a man () do not copulate coitus () as with a woman"" refer to homosexual conduct. For example, according to Hays, although the word  appears nowhere in Greek literature prior to Paul's use of it, it is evidently a rendering into Greek of the standard rabbinic term for ""one who lies with a male [as with a woman]"" (Leviticus 18:22; 20:13). Moreover, despite recent challenges to this interpretation, the meaning is confirmed by the evidence of Sybilline Oracles 2.73. Paul here repeats the standard Jewish condemnation of homosexual conduct. Malick (op cit) writes, ""it is significant that of all the terms available in the Greek language, Paul chose a compound from the Septuagint that in the broadest sense described men lying with men as they would lie with women."" According to Scobie, ""it clearly echoes the Greek of [Leviticus] 18:22 and 20:13 in the LXX ( = ""male"", and  = ""bed""), so that  literally means ""one who goes to bed with a male"".

David Wright argues that the compound word refers to those who sleep with males, and denotes ""'male homosexual activity' without qualification."" Haas, reviewing the various arguments on both sides, concluded that ""an examination of the biblical passages from linguistic, historical and ethical-theological perspectives fails to support the revisionist ethic and reinforces the traditional Christian teaching that homosexual practice is morally wrong."" Via also agrees arsenokoitēs refers to homosexual activity. James B. De Young presents similar arguments.

Malakos

This word is translated as ""male prostitutes"" (NRSV), ""effeminate"" (NASB), or ""catamites"" (TJB; in the footnotes of the NKJV), in 1 Corinthians 6:9.

Arguments against a reference to homosexual behaviour
The Greek word ; malakos carries a root meaning of soft, luxurious or dainty, but here, G. Fee argues, it is used in a much darker way, possibly referring to the more passive partner in a homosexual relationship. According to Scroggs (op cit), the word malakos in Paul's list refers specifically to this category of person, the effeminate call-boy. Others, for example Olson, based on previous and subsequent uses of the term, interprets malakos to mean an effeminate but not necessarily homosexual man. Olson argues that the μαλακοί in Paul's time, ""almost always referred in a negative, pejorative way to a widely despised group of people who functioned as effeminate 'call boys'.""

Dale B. Martin argues that ""it would never have occurred to an ancient person to think that  or any other word indicating the feminine in itself referred to homosexual sex at all. It could just as easily refer to heterosexual sex.""

Arguments for a reference to homosexual behaviour
Lexical evidence from Greek texts indicates the word was used to refer to the passive partner in a male homosexual act. For example, Malick (op cit) writes that a significant expression of this usage is found in a letter from Demophon, a wealthy Egyptian, to Ptolemaeus, a police official, concerning needed provisions for a coming festival. According to Ukleja, ""a strong possible translation of both malakos (and arsenokoitēs) is the morally loose (effeminate) who allow themselves to be used homosexually and the person who is a practicing homosexual."" Ukleja cites a number of classical Greek sources in support his assertion.

The meaning of the word is not confined to male prostitutes. According to Malick (op cit), when malakos is employed in reference to sexual relationships of men with men, it is not a technical term for male call-boys in a pederastic setting. The term may mean effeminate with respect to boys or men who take the role of a woman in homosexual relationships. Nor is the meaning of the word confined to sexually exploited males.

Standard Greek lexicons and dictionaries understand this word as a reference to the passive partner in a male homosexual act.The vice catalog of 1 Cor 6:9 mentions the μαλακοί, soft people / weaklings, as reprehensible examples of passive homosexuality (cf. Rom 1:27; Lev 20:13; Ep. Arist. 152; Sib. Or. 3:184ff., 584ff.; see Billerbeck III, 70; H. Conzelmann, 1 Cor [Hermeneia] ad loc. [bibliography]).', Balz & Schneider, 'Exegetical Dictionary of the New Testament', volume 2, p. 381 (1990).'88.281 μαλακόςb, οῦ m: the passive male partner in homosexual intercourse—'homosexual.' For a context of μαλακόςb, see 1 Cor 6:9–10 in 88.280. As in Greek, a number of other languages also have entirely distinct terms for the active and passive roles in homosexual intercourse.', Louw & Nida, 'Greek-English lexicon of the New Testament: Based on semantic domains', volume 1, p. 771-772 (electronic ed. of the 2nd edition 1996).'3120. μαλακός malakós; fem. malakḗ, neut. malakón, adj. Soft to the touch, spoken of clothing made of soft materials, fine texture (Matt. 11:8; Luke 7:25). Figuratively it means effeminate or a person who allows himself to be sexually abused contrary to nature. Paul, in 1 Cor. 6:9, joins the malakoí, the effeminate, with arsenokoítai (733), homosexuals, Sodomites.', Zodhiates, 'The Complete Word Study Dictionary: New Testament' (electronic ed. 2000). Most scholars think it means someone wilfully engaged in homosexual relations.

Some theologians have argued that, when read in historical context, the Jewish Platonist philosopher Philo of Alexandria used the term in reference to temple prostitution.

According to Roy Ward, malakos was used to describe an item soft to the touch, such as a soft pillow or cloth. When used negatively, the term meant faint-hearted, lacking in self-control, weak or morally weak with no link to same-gender sexual behaviour.

Porneia

In Matthew 15: 19-20 (KJV) Jesus says:

In Mark 7: 20-23 (KJV) it says:

Whether these lists include homosexuality depends on the translation of  (sexual impurity). Translations of these passages generally translate  as fornication rather than sexual impurity (see Leviticus). Some interpret the translation of  more broadly, to encompass sexual immorality in general, though there is disagreement over whether such an interpretation is supported by the writings of the Church Fathers.

Pais

This event is referred to in both Matthew 8:5-13 and Luke 7:1-10 and tells of Jesus healing a centurion's servant. Luke 7:2 (TNIV) says: ""There a centurion's servant, whom his master valued highly, was sick and about to die."" The term translated from the Greek as ""servant"" in this verse is  (. Elsewhere in the two accounts, the term used for the ill person is  (), a term that can be translated in a number of different ways including ""child"" (, Matthew 2:16; Lk 2:43, 8:51-54 where it refers to a girl), ""son"" (John 4:51) or ""servant"" (Lk 15:26, Acts 4:25); elsewhere it is unclear whether ""son"" or ""servant"" is meant (Acts 3:13, 3:26, 4:27, 4:30).

Horner and Daniel A. Helminiak both suggest a homosexual theme to this text. Helminiak argues that this is implied by the broader context of the narrative suggesting an unusual level of concern about the servant, whereas Horner suggests that use of the term ""valued highly"" implies a sexual relationship. Horner goes on to argue that, as Jesus commended the centurion for his faith (Matthew 8:10; Luke 7:9), it shows that Jesus approved of their relationship, otherwise he would have condemned him. However, a contrasting viewpoint is that the term ""highly valued"" (, ) simply suggests a genuine care for the person or, more archaically, that the centurion was fond of this slave, and that the term  has no hint of sexual content in any of its various appearances in the Bible. Jay Michaelson argues that the term pais is actually mistranslated as servant when its true meaning is lover.

Other biblical scholars dismiss any suggestions of a homosexual theme as deliberately distorted interpretations of the text.Marston, P. (2003) Christians, Gays and Gay Christians. Free Methodists. Marston argues that Jesus would not have condoned any homosexual relationship, in line with the weight of other scriptural evidence, while Chapman suggests that even if the relationship had been homosexual, his lack of condemnation does not necessarily equate to his approval of them.

Other issues of sexuality
Eunuchs
In Matthew 19:12, Jesus discusses eunuchs who were born as such, eunuchs who were made so by others, and eunuchs who choose to live as such for the kingdom of heaven. Clement of Alexandria wrote in his commentary on it that ""some men, from their birth, have a natural sense of repulsion from a woman; and those who are naturally so constituted do well not to marry"". The select 144,000 referenced in the heavenly vision of John in Revelation 14:4 are ""the ones who have not been defiled with women...they are the ones who follow the Lamb wherever He goes...these have been purchased from among men as first fruits to God and the Lamb. And no lie was found in their mouth; they are blameless.""

The First Council of Nicaea in 325 AD established 20 new laws called canons.  The first of these was the prohibition of self castration.

The Ethiopian eunuch, an early gentile convert encountered in Acts 8, has been described as an early gay Christian, based on the fact that the word ""eunuch"" in the Bible was not always used literally, as in Matthew 19:12.

Female homosexuality
In the Epistle to the Romans 1:26-27 (ESV), Paul writes, ""For this reason God gave them up to dishonorable passions. For their women exchanged natural relations for those that are contrary to nature"". This is the only known specific reference in the Bible to female homosexuality. Most interpreters assume that, due to the analogy with same-sex lust between males, Paul is referring to female same-sex behavior. This assumption is not conclusive, and it remains difficult to discern exactly what Paul meant by women exchanging natural intercourse for unnatural.

Brooten cites both Anastasios and Augustine as explicitly rejecting the 'lesbian hypothesis' (p. 337). Hanks asserts that ""not until John Chrysostom (ca 400 CE) does anyone (mis)interpret Romans 1:26 as referring to relations between two women"" (p. 90). Townsley notes that other early writers, possibly including Chrysostom, reject the 'lesbian' hypothesis, specifically, Ambrosiaster, Didymus the Blind and Clement of Alexandria.

Developmental sexuality
Thomas E. Schmidt's dictionary entry on the topic concludes that a process of spirituality and sexuality are developmental in the life of Christian believers and proper instruction is towards ""a growth in discipleship"" rather than self-identity.

Historical and cultural perspectives

The history of Christianity and homosexuality has been much debated. The Hebrew Bible/Old Testament and its traditional interpretations in Judaism and Christianity have historically affirmed and endorsed a patriarchal and heteronormative approach towards human sexuality, favouring exclusively penetrative vaginal intercourse between men and women within the boundaries of marriage over all other forms of human sexual activity, including autoeroticism, masturbation, oral sex, non-penetrative and non-heterosexual sexual intercourse (all of which have been labeled as ""sodomy"" at various times), believing and teaching that such behaviors are forbidden because they're considered sinful, and further compared to or derived from the behavior of the alleged residents of Sodom and Gomorrah. However, the status of LGBT people in early Christianity is debated.

Many commentators have argued that the references to homosexuality in the New Testament, or the Bible in general, have to be understood in their proper historical context. Indeed, most interpreters come to the text with a preconceived notion of what the Bible has to say about normative sexual behaviors, influencing subsequent interpretations. For example, William Walker says that the very notion of ""homosexuality"" (or even ""heterosexuality"", ""bisexuality"" and ""sexual orientation"") is essentially a modern concept that would simply have been unintelligible to the New Testament writers. The word ""homosexuality"" and the concept of sexual orientation as being separate from one's perceived masculinity or femininity (i.e. gender identity) did not take shape until the 19th century. Moreover, although some ancient Romans (i.e. doctors, astrologers, etc.) discussed congenital inclinations to unconventional sexual activities such as homosexuality, this classification fails to correspond to a modern psychological, biological and genetic distinction between homosexual, heterosexual and bisexual orientations. However, according to Gagnon, the concept of homosexual orientation was not wholly unknown in the Greco-Roman milieu. Moreover, he asserts that there is absolutely no evidence that modern orientation theory would have had any impact on Paul changing his strong negative valuation of homosexual practice.

A statement by the Bishops of the Church of England (""Issues in Human Sexuality"") in 1991 illustrates a categorization and understanding of homosexuality, claiming that in ancient times ""society recognized the existence of those, predominantly male, who appeared to be attracted entirely to members of their own sex."" (""Issues in Human Sexuality"" para 2.16, lines 8-9) which almost parallels that of modern ideation. The same study is careful to point out that ""the modern concept of orientation has been developed against a background of genetic and psychological theory which was not available to the ancient world.""

Sarah Ruden, in her Paul Among the People'' (2010) argues that the only form of homosexual sex that was apparent to the public in Paul's time was exploitative pederasty, in which slave boys were raped by adult males, often very violently. Paul's condemnation of homosexuality, Ruden argues, can be interpreted most plausibly as a criticism of this kind of brutally exploitative behavior.

82,"Major Theodore Woolsey Winthrop (September 22, 1828 – June 10, 1861) was a writer, lawyer, and world traveller. He was one of the first Union officers killed in the American Civil War.

Biography
Winthrop was born in New Haven, Connecticut, a descendant of several prominent Colonial families. He was descended through his father from Governor John Winthrop, and through his mother from theologian Jonathan Edwards and early settlers George (Joris) Woolsey and Thomas Cornell.

He graduated in 1848 from Yale University, where his uncle Theodore Dwight Woolsey was President, and he was a member of the Phi Chapter of the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity. He traveled for a year in Great Britain and Europe and then through the United States, settling in Staten Island in the 1850s. After contributing to periodicals, short sketches, and stories, which attracted little attention, Winthrop enlisted in the 7th Regiment, New York State Militia, an early volunteer unit of the Federal Army that answered President Abraham Lincoln's call for troops in 1861. He wrote a popular essay about the experience titled ""Our March to Washington.""  He was appointed Major and soon became an aide-de-camp to Major General Benjamin Butler, commander of the Department of Virginia headquartered at Fort Monroe.  Winthrop had, along with his younger brother William Winthrop who later became the nation's leading authority on military law, long been an abolitionist.  Butler credited Winthrop with first formulating the policy that automatically conferred freedmen status on escaped slaves who entered into Union Army held territory.

Battle of Big Bethel
At the Battle of Big Bethel on June 10, 1861, he volunteered for General Ebenezer W. Peirce's staff and drew up a crude plan of battle. After a Federal attack to the enemy right flank was foiled, Winthrop led an ill-fated assault on the Confederate left held by four companies of the 1st Regiment North Carolina Infantry, under the command of Colonel (later Lieutenant General) Daniel Harvey Hill.

In the heat of battle, Major Winthrop leapt onto the trunk of a fallen tree and reportedly yelled, ""One more charge boys, and the day is ours.""  Soon thereafter, he was killed by a musket ball to the heart and became the first casualty of rank for the Northern side in what history regards as the first pitched land battle of the Civil War. Ironically, ardent abolitionist Winthrop may have been shot by the African-American slave of a Confederate officer in the 1st North Carolina Infantry. (Three different soldiers, as well as this slave, referred to in the records only as ""Sam,"" claimed to have killed him.)

Author
Winthrop's novels, for which he had failed to find a publisher during his lifetime, appeared posthumously. They include John Brent, founded on his experiences in the far West, and Edwin Brothertoft, a story of the American Revolution. Cecil Dreeme, his most important work, was a semi-autobiographical novel dealing with social mores and gender roles set at New York University, where Winthrop had once been a lodger. Other works include The Canoe and the Saddle and Life in the Open Air. His sister, Laura Winthrop Johnson, assembled a collection of his poems and prose organized by the time period of his life Life and Poems of Theodore Winthrop.

Works published during Winthrop's lifetime include a pamphlet accompanying the painting The Heart of the Andes by his friend Frederic Edwin Church, distributed in 1859. After Winthrop's death in 1861, the Atlantic Monthly published sketches of the military campaigns in Virginia based on his own experiences.

87,"Norris McDonald (born 1942) is a Canadian journalist and member of the Canadian Motorsport Hall of Fame.

He is currently automotive editor of the Toronto Star, Canada's largest-circulation newspaper, where he is responsible for the Saturday Wheels section and the newspaper's automotive website. He is also the Star's motorsport reporter and columnist. He was previously news editor and entertainment editor of the Star, news editor and assistant foreign editor of the Globe and Mail, and editorial page editor and associate editor of the Kingston Whig-Standard, where he also wrote a humour column. Early in his career, he wrote sports for the Pembroke Daily Observer and was a general assignment reporter on the Orillia Packet & Times.

Biography

Early life

McDonald flunked out of Stamford Collegiate in Niagara Falls, Ontario, in 1962 after spending seven years there and never getting past Grade 11. In 1969, he graduated from Sir George Williams University (now Concordia University) in Montreal where he'd been admitted as a mature student. Named to the Honour Roll in his graduating year, his thesis in sociology, ""Prostitutes are Human Beings—An Organized Counter-Institution,"" written with Clive L. Copeland, was subsequently published by Random House in the 1971 textbook Deviance, Reality and Change, edited by H. Taylor Buckner.

Career

His first newspaper job, in Orillia, saw him cover his first auto race, on the ice of Lake Couchiching during the 1962 Orillia Winter Carnival. He covered his first Indianapolis 500 in 1969 and his first Formula One Canadian Grand Prix in 1970, both for the Globe and Mail.

In 1982, believing strongly that journalists should know everything about who and what they cover and finding himself writing more and more about auto racing, McDonald went racing himself in a high-speed, high-expense class of open-wheel, open-cockpit car and competition called supermodified racing. Freely admitting he wasn't very good but noting that he was never black-flagged, McDonald went racing one night, only to be asked to fill in for an absent trackside announcer at Oswego Speedway on the shores of Lake Ontario in northern New York state. Putting his journalistic skills to work in interviewing drivers and reporting from ""the pits,"" McDonald proved to be successful and popular and did the infield announcing job at the ""Home of the Supermodifieds"" for close to 15 years.

Although he was always employed by newspapers, he also appeared on radio and television. His racing program, Motorsport Radio, co-hosted by Jim Martyn, was carried by Toronto all-sports station The Fan 590 in the early 2000s. While in Kingston, Ontario, he hosted a television program, Feedback Live, that won critical acclaim from Canadian broadcasting legend Peter Trueman. Writing in his column in the Toronto Star's Star Week TV magazine, Trueman said: “McDonald—an old-time newshound with Runyonesque overtones—is a natural on television.”

Family

McDonald is the father of three children, Cameron, Carolina and Duncan, and lives with his partner, Susan Greene, in Mississauga, Ontario. He has no plans to retire.

Honours and awards

For his stories and columns on amateur/non-professional racing and racers, many of whom would never expect to be profiled in the country's biggest newspaper, McDonald was honoured in 2006 by being presented the Canadian Automobile Sport Club's Media Award.

For his efforts at the ""Steel Palace,"" he was inducted into the Oswego Speedway Hall of Fame in 2010.

The highlight of his motorsport career came in 2014 when he became the first journalist to be inducted into the Canadian Motorsport Hall of Fame in a class that included woman racing pioneer Diana Carter, administrator John Magill, road-racing champion Scott Maxwell, Indy racing star Paul Tracy and international inductee Nigel Mansell.

Gameplay

Story

Atelier Totori takes place 5 years after the previous game, Atelier Rorona. It begins with Totori in the fishing village of Alanya, her hometown, and ends after five years pass.
Totooria Helmold is Rorona's student who is looking for her missing mother. After the events of Atelier Rorona, Rorona has been traveling across Arland teaching alchemy. One day, Totori and her older sister find a starving Rorona collapsed on their doorstep. She teaches Totori about alchemy, adopting her as a student. Since then, Totori has been learning alchemy on her own.

Everyone in Alanya believes that Totori's mother is dead. However, Totori thinks she is still alive, so she travels to Arland in order to become an adventurer and search for her. Players follow Totori on her journey exploring the world, improving her alchemy, and searching for her long-lost mother.

Characters

Release
It was first released on PlayStation 3 in Japan on June 24, 2010 in a standard and premium edition. The premium edition comes in an oversized box with a limited edition crystal paperweight.

The PlayStation 3 version was localized by NIS America, and released on September 27, 2011 in North American territories, September 30, 2011 in Europe, and October 6, 2011 in Australia. In North America, a premium edition was also released. It came with the game, as well as a softcover artbook and partial soundtrack CD. For customers ordering from NIS America's online store, the premium edition also came with a double-sided poster.

On November 29, 2012, an enhanced port, titled Atelier Totori Plus: The Alchemist of Arland 2, was released in Japan for the PlayStation Vita. It was released in standard and premium versions. The premium set came with a crystal paperweight, but it has a different image and coloration from the previous paperweight. The main additional features to the port are the addition of a new post-game dungeon, along with several new boss enemies, new artwork, and new costumes for the player character. It also makes use of the Vita's back touchpad for navigating the world map.

The Vita version was localized in Europe and North America as Atelier Totori: The Adventurer of Arland Plus, and released on March 20, 2013 as a digital download on the PlayStation Network. It was given no official announcement, with the only clue being an R18+ rating that appeared on the Australian Classification Board's website. This was a huge jump from the PS3 version's PG rating with the reason for the rating being ""mild violence and infrequent coarse language"", while the given reason for the R18+ rating being ""references to sexual violence"". In North America, the game received a T for Teen (ages 13+) rating while it received a B (ages 12+) rating in Japan, a 12 rating in South Korea, and a 12 rating in Europe.

Reception

The game sold a total of 53,871 copies during its first week on sale in Japan and was the third best-selling game of the week, an increase of 10,000 copies from the first week sales of Atelier Rorona. The game has sold a total of 144,261 copies in Japan.

Reviews have been generally favorable; the game currently has an average score of 74 out of 100 on Metacritic.

PSX Extreme rated it 8.7/10, stating that ""after five hours of play with Gust’s new effort, I realized this all clicked. After ten hours, it not only clicked, it was becoming addictive. Turn-based combat is not dead, and despite my aversion to anime, this is a beautiful, pleasing production."" RPGamer rated it a 4.5/5, complimenting its story in that ""Atelier Totori is not an epic RPG like many other games in the genre try to be, but its allure allows it to stand tall as a bittersweet and emotionally charged experience that may require gamers to pull out the tissue box.""

IGN gave the game a 7.5/10, praising the graphics and gameplay, but said that, while the core story is good, ""the writing is mostly groan-worthy and the voice acting rarely does anything to save it either.""

Famitsu gave the PS Vita version a review score of 29/40.

89,"Natasha Exelby is an Australian journalist. She is currently a news reporter for 10 News First.

Career

Seven Queensland
Following her graduation from the Queensland University of Technology in 2005, Exelby commenced her career as a full-time journalist, working as a reporter for Seven Queensland's local news bulletins in Bundaberg and Townsville.

Network 10
Exelby relocated to Canberra in 2008 where she began a three-year stint as a Ten News political reporter, working in the Canberra Press Gallery for Network Ten which included covering the 2010 Australian federal election.

Following her time in Canberra, Exelby became a senior journalist and news presenter in Sydney.

In June 2013, while reading news headlines on Ten's late news bulletin, Exelby began giggling while reading a number of serious items.   After the incident, Exelby apologised while Network Ten released a statement describing Exelby's actions as ""totally unacceptable"" and said there was no excusing her behaviour.

Exelby served as one of the original presenters on Ten's breakfast news program Wake Up, working alongside Natarsha Belling and James Mathison, which launched on 4 November 2013.  However, Exelby was dropped from the program less than three weeks after the first broadcast with creator Adam Boland blaming a lack of chemistry between the three presenters for the decision.

Exelby has since said she was told about her axing in a carpark, 45 minutes before it was publicly announced.

In June 2019, it was announced that Exelby would join 10 News First in Melbourne as a presenter and reporter.

TRT World
In October 2015, Exelby began working for the Turkish Radio and Television Corporation's international news channel TRT World in Turkey.

Following her work with TRT World, Exelby relocated back to Australia in November 2016, where she then established a media consultancy business.

Australian Broadcasting Corporation
In 2017, Exelby commenced working as a casual news presenter on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's news channel ABC News.

While reading a late night ABC News bulletin on Saturday 8 April 2017, Exelby momentarily became distracted by her pen and failed to realise she was on air following the conclusion of a story.   Upon realising she was on air, Exelby gasped and hurriedly introduced the sport segment, presented by Meredith Sheehan.

When the blooper was highlighted on Media Watch's social media pages, the clip went viral.  Following this, there was numerous stories published reporting Exelby had been punished by the ABC and taken off air because her blooper had gone viral.  The belief that Exelby had been fired prompted many messages of support from fellow journalists, television presenters, politicians and entertainers, with the hashtag #putyourbloopersout emerging on social media in support.

However ABC news director Gaven Morris has denied Exelby was fired, describing the many media reports as ""untrue"" because Exelby was a freelance journalist and as such was not rostered for any additional on air shifts.   Morris' statement followed an earlier statement released by an ABC spokesperson which also said Exelby was a ""casual contributor"" rather than a staff member and was only booked for occasional on air shifts.

Some commentators accused Morris of lying and maintained Exelby had indeed been punished. Exelby also maintains the ABC told her she was unable to go live on air again following the blooper, and had offered her producing shifts instead.

I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!
In 2019, Exelby was a contestant on the fifth season of Network Ten reality show I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!, in which she placed 7th out of the 14 celebrities competing.

90,"Will Allen (born June 17, 1982) is a former American football safety. Allen played college football for Ohio State University, and received All-American honors.  He was drafted in the fourth round of the 2004 NFL Draft by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and also played for the Dallas Cowboys and Pittsburgh Steelers.

Early years
Allen was born in Dayton, Ohio.  He attended Wayne High School in Huber Heights, Ohio, and played high school football for the Wayne Warriors. He was a member of Wayne High School's 1999 Division I State Runner-Up team, along with fellow Ohio State recruit John Hollins.  His high school jersey #4 is the only number that has been officially retired by Wayne High School.  Allen was named Division I first-team all-Ohio by The Associated Press for his senior season.  He was rated as the No.4 defensive back prospect and the No.27 overall prospect in the Midwest by SuperPrep, and rated as the No.53 defensive back prospect in the nation by Rivals100.com.

College career
Allen received an athletic scholarship to attend Ohio State University, where he was a four-year letterman for coach Jim Tressel's Ohio State Buckeyes football team from 2000 to 2003.  As a senior in 2003, he was a consensus first-team All-America selection.  In his first three seasons at Ohio State he played behind three-time All American Mike Doss, seeing action on the field primarily in nickel coverage on passing downs.

Allen is perhaps best remembered among college football fans for two plays made during the 2002 BCS national championship season. The first occurred during the 2002 Ohio State-Michigan game, intercepting a pass from Michigan quarterback John Navarre during the closing seconds to preserve the 14–9 victory and an undefeated regular season. The second play was only one game later in the 2003 Fiesta Bowl for the national championship. In the second half, Allen tackled Miami running back Willis McGahee and delivered a shoulder blow to his left knee. McGahee had to be helped off the field; he suffered ligament damage and was forced to miss his whole rookie year in the NFL.

Professional career

Tampa Bay Buccaneers

Allen played in every game in his rookie year on special teams but saw increasing time as a safety in the final weeks of the season.  He made his first NFL interception against the Carolina Panthers and his first touchdown in week 6 of the following season against the Miami Dolphins. He started eight games in 2005, playing at both free safety and strong safety due to injuries to Jermaine Phillips and Dexter Jackson.

Allen's most noted contribution in his young NFL career occurred against the Green Bay Packers in  2005, when he intercepted Packers quarterback Brett Favre twice in the fourth quarter. Buccaneers starting safety, Dexter Jackson, had been injured midway through the second quarter with a hamstring strain. Allen came into the game as a substitute. Allen was the Buccaneers' special teams captain in 2008. Allen was the first alternate for NFC Special Teams for the 2009 Pro Bowl. He was re-signed to a 1-year $2.35 million contract on February 28, 2009.

Pittsburgh Steelers
On March 8, 2010, Allen signed with the Pittsburgh Steelers. On November 9, 2012, Allen was fined $7,875 for a late hit against New York Giants receiver Victor Cruz in Week 9.

Dallas Cowboys
On March 27, 2013, Allen signed a one-year, $840,000 contract with the Dallas Cowboys. The deal included a $65,000 signing bonus.  He was released on October 8, 2013.

Second stint with Steelers
Allen returned to the Steelers in October 2013. He signed a 1-year $1,020,000 contract, then another $1,050,000 contract with the Steelers the following year.

The Will Allen Foundation

The Will Allen Foundation was created in May 2008 to inspire youth to attain their personal best and to be an influence in the lives of families in Dayton, Ohio; Tampa, Florida; and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The foundation's main focus is to provide students in the Quest for Real Life Success program with ""real"" life experiences and expose them to new and rewarding opportunities. Quest allows them to explore their curiosities and gives them the desire to strive and achieve goals outside of the everyday opportunities currently afforded to them.

The mission of the Will Allen Foundation is to remove barriers by providing programs and resources for those committed to achieving their personal best, bettering themselves, their families and their communities.

The vision of the Will Allen Foundation is to provide a level playing field for all, allowing for each individual to achieve their greatest success.

92,"Gherla (; ; ) is a municipality in Cluj County, Romania (in the historical region of Transylvania). It is located  from Cluj-Napoca on the river Someșul Mic, and has a population of 20,203. Three villages are administered by the city: Băița (formerly Chirău, and Kérő in Hungarian), Hășdate (Szamoshesdát) and Silivaș (Vizszilvás).

The city was formerly known as Armenopolis ( Hayakaghak; ; ) because it was populated by Armenians.

History

A clay tablet containing a fragmentary Old Persian cuneiform of the Achaemenid king Darius I was found at Gherla in 1937. It may be connected to Darius I's epigraphic activities  in relation to his Scythian campaign of 513 BC as reported by Herodotus.

The locality was first recorded in 1291 as a village named Gherlahida, (probably derived from the Slavic word grle, meaning ""ford""). The second name was Armenian, Հայաքաղաք Hayakaghak, meaning ""Armenian city""; it took the Medieval Latin and Greek official name Armenopolis, as well as the German alternative name Armenierstadt. Later, the name Szamosújvár was used in official Hungarian records, meaning ""the new town on the Someș"". Before 1918, Gherla was part of the Kingdom of Hungary comitatus of Szolnok-Doboka. It was again part of Hungary between 1940 and until the end of World War II.

The modern city was built in the early 18th century by Armenians, successors of the Cilician Armenian diaspora, who had originally settled in Crimea and Moldavia, and moved to Transylvania sometime after 1650. After a two years' campaign by the Armenian-Catholic Bishop Oxendius Vărzărescu, they converted from the Armenian Apostolic Church to the Armenian Catholic Church.

Gherla is the seat of the Ordinariate for Catholics of Armenian Rite in Romania, as well as that of a Greek-Catholic diocese – the Cluj-Gherla Diocese (suffragan to the Greek-Catholic Archbishop of Alba Iulia and Făgăraș-Blaj, who resided in Blaj). In the center of the city lie the Saint Gregory the Illuminator and the Holy Trinity Armenian Cathedral. The main Armenian-Catholic church was built in 1792. The Greek Catholic diocese was created by the Papal Bull Ad Apostolicam Sedem of November 26, 1853, and the first bishop was Ioan Alexi.

A Habsburg fortress was built here and converted to a prison in 1785. During the Communist regime, the prison was used for political detainees (see Gherla prison). Today it is a Romanian  high-security prison.

The town is often visited by Orthodox pilgrims on their way to the nearby village of Nicula and Nicula Monastery.

Gherla also had a significant Jewish population which was decimated during the Holocaust. After the war most of the remaining Jewish population left the city. The Synagogue and the Holocaust Memorial Monument are visited by tourists from many countries.

Population
According to the 2011 Romanian census, there were 20,982 people living within the city, as follows:
 15,952 (76.0%) Romanians
 3,435 (16.4%) Hungarians
 735 (3.5%) Roma
 61 (0.3%) others, including 16 Germans

93,"Kusaila (Arabic:  Kusaila Ibn Malzam, Latin: Caecilius) was a 7th-century Berber Christian king of the kingdom of Altava and leader of the Awraba tribe, a Christianised sedentary tribe of the Aures of the Imazighen and possibly Christian king of the Sanhaja. Under his rule his domain stretched from Volubilis in the west to the Aurès in the east and later Kairouan and the interior of Ifriqiya. He is known for prosecuting an effective Berber military resistance against the Muslim conquest of the Maghreb in the 680s. His name means ""leopard"" in the Berber language. Kusaila died in the year 688 fighting the Muslims.

Etymology 
Possibly from Caesilius (Cecilian), a Roman name widely used among Christianized Berbers, but more likely from Berber (Aksil) ""Feline"", still attested in the dialects of Aurès, region of which Kusila was native.

Historical importance

Initially the Berber States were able to defeat the Umayyad invaders at the Battle of Vescera (modern Biskra in Algeria), that was fought in 682 AD between the Berbers of King Kusaila and their Byzantine allies from the Exarchate of Africa against an Umayyad army under Uqba ibn Nafi, the founder of Kairouan.

Uqba ibn Nafi had led his men in an invasion across North Africa, eventually reaching the Atlantic Ocean and marching as far south as the Draa and Sous rivers. On his return, he was met by the Berber-Byzantine coalition at Tahuda south of Vescera, his army was crushed and he himself was killed. As a result of this crushing defeat Kusaila took control of Byzacena and a large part of Ifriqiya, the Arabs lost all of their land in Africa west of Cyrenaica and were expelled from the area of modern Tunisia and eastern Algeria for more than a decade.

Biography

His homeland was Tlemcen, now in Algeria, according to Ibn Khaldun. However, this account dates from the 14th century, some 700 years later. Indeed, Kusaila, according to historian Noe Villaverde, was probably a king of Altava. Other sources closer to Kusaila's time (ninth century is the earliest available) associate him only with the Aurès Mountains in Algeria. Kusaila grew up in Berber tribal territory during the time of the Byzantine exarchate.

Kusaila is speculated to be a Christian based on his Roman-sounding name. According to historian Gabriel Camps, his name was a possible translation in Berber of the Latin name ""Caecilius"", showing that he was from a noble Berber family. His name even intrigued Orientalists; unlike other Berber kings, like his predecessors Masuna, Masties, Mastigas and Garmul, Arab chroniclers likely transmitted us a name of another language: Latin Caecilius, a common name found in the graves of Volubilis.

He was captured by Uqba but in AD 683 he succeeded in escaping and raised against his tormentors a large force of Christian Berber and Byzantine soldiers. And attacked Uqba, killing him near Biskra. After Uqba's death his armies retreated from Kairouan, which Kusaila took as his capital, and for a while he seems to have been at least in name the master of all North Africa. But his respite from battle was to be short-lived. Five years later Kusaila was killed in battle against fresh Arab forces led by a Muslim general from Damascus. This soldier was himself ambushed and put to death by Byzantine sea-raiders shortly afterwards. For a while confusion reigned, but the Awraba recognized the weakness of their position and eventually capitulated to the newly re-organized and reinforced Arab army. With the death of Kusaila, the torch of resistance passed to a tribe known as the Jerawa, who had their home in the Aurès.
 
According to late Muslim accounts (11th century through to ibn Khaldun in the 14th century) the amir of the Muslim invaders, who was then a freed slave called Abu al-Muhajir Dinar, surprisingly invited Kusaila to meet with him in his camp. Abu al-Muhajir Dinar convinced him to accept Islam and join his army with a promise of full equality with the Arabs (678). Abu al-Muhajir was a master in diplomacy and thoroughly impressed Kusaila with not only his piety but with his high sense of respect and etiquette. Kusaila incorporated the Awraba-Sanhaja into the conquering Arab force and participated in their uniformly successful campaigns under Abu al-Muhajir.

This amir was then forcibly replaced by Uqba ibn Nafi, who treated Kusaila and his men with contempt. Eventually Uqba's disrespect enraged Kusaila and provoked a plot of revenge. On the army's return from Morocco, Uqba allowed his troops to break up and go home. The remainder, about 300, were vulnerable and exhausted. On the return march to Kairouan, Kusaila joined with the Byzantine forces and organised an ambush. The Christian-Berber force, about 5000 strong, defeated the Arabs and felled Uqba at Tahudha near Biskra in 683. Kusaila now held undisputed mastery over North Africa and marched to Kairouan in triumph.

The above account is disputed by some historians, who prefer the earlier 9th-century sources. According to these, Abu al-Muhajir had no connection with Kusaila, nor did Uqba ibn Nafi until he was ambushed at Tahudha. These earlier sources also describe Kusaila as a Christian, not a Muslim convert. They do agree, however, that he led a Berber force when he defeated Uqba.

In 687 AD Arab reinforcements arrived under Zuhayr ibn Qays. Kusaila met them in 688 AD at the Battle of Mamma. Vastly outnumbered, the Awraba were defeated and Kusaila was killed. In 693, Caliph Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan sent an army of 40,000 men commanded by Hassan ibn al-Nu'man to Cyrenaica and Tripolitania in order to remove the Byzantine threat to the Umayyads in North Africa. They met no rival groups until they reached Tunisia where they captured Carthage and defeated the Byzantines and Imazighen around Bizerte. However, it was not the last instance of Berber resistance, since Dihya succeeded Kusaila as the war leader of the Berber tribes in the 680s.

96,"""Strangers in the Night"" is a song composed by Bert Kaempfert with English lyrics by Charles Singleton and Eddie Snyder. Kaempfert originally used it under the title ""Beddy Bye"" as part of the instrumental score for the movie A Man Could Get Killed. The song was made famous in 1966 by Frank Sinatra, although it was initially given to Melina Mercouri, who thought that a man's vocals would better suit the melody and therefore declined to sing it.

Reaching #1 on both the Billboard Hot 100 chart and the Easy Listening chart, it was the title song for Sinatra's 1966 album Strangers in the Night, which became his most commercially successful album. The song also reached No. 1 on the UK Singles Chart.

Sinatra's recording won him the Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance and the Grammy Award for Record of the Year, as well as a Grammy Award for Best Arrangement Accompanying a Vocalist or Instrumentalist for Ernie Freeman at the Grammy Awards of 1967.

Authorship disputes

Avo Uvezian
In an interview with The New York Times, Avo Uvezian discussed the origins of ""Strangers in the Night"", saying that he had composed the song for Frank Sinatra while in New York, at the request of a mutual friend who wanted to introduce the two. He wrote the melody, after which someone else added the lyrics, and the song was originally titled ""Broken Guitar"". Uvezian presented the song to Sinatra a week later, but Sinatra did not like the lyrics, so they were rewritten, and the song became ""Strangers in the Night"".

When asked why Kaempfert claimed he had composed the tune, Uvezian noted that Kaempfert was a friend of his, and in the industry, so Uvezian asked him to publish the German version in Germany in order that the two could split the profits, because Uvezian thought he would not receive royalties in the US. Uvezian said that when he gave the music to Kaempfert, the lyrics had already been revised and the song re-titled. Uvezian claimed that Kaempfert had given him a letter acknowledging Uvezian as the composer.

Ivo Robić
It is sometimes claimed that Croatian singer Ivo Robić was the composer of ""Strangers in the Night"", and that he sold the rights to Kaempfert after having entered it, without success, in a song contest in Yugoslavia. In an interview on Croatian TV with Croatian composer Stjepan Mihaljinec, Robić said that he had composed a song ""Ta ljetna noć"" (That Summer Night) and sent it to a festival in the former Yugoslavia, where it was rejected. Then he sang a first few bars from that song, identical to the first few bars of ""Strangers in the Night"" (""Strangers in the night, exchanging glances...""). Robić claimed that, later, Kaempfert ""composed"" that very same song for him, which later became known as ""Strangers in the Night"". That has never been substantiated. Robić, often referred to as ""Mr. Morgen"" for his 1950s chart success with ""Morgen"", which was created in collaboration with Kaempfert, was the singer of the Croatian version of the song, titled ""Stranci u noći"".

Robić's recording was released in 1966 by the Yugoslav record company Jugoton, with the serial number EPY-3779. On the label of the record, Kaempfert and Marija Renota are stated as authors, with Renota being the author of the Croatian lyrics. The English title, ""Strangers in the Night"", was created after the composition, when New York music publishers Roosevelt Music asked lyricists Eddie Snyder and Charles Singleton to put some words to the tune. ""Stranci u noći"" is a literal translation of that phrase.

Philippe-Gérard
In 1967, French composer Michel Philippe-Gérard (more commonly known as Philippe-Gérard) claimed that the melody of ""Strangers"" was based on his composition ""Magic Tango"", which was published in 1953 through Chappell & Co. in New York. Royalties from the song were thus frozen until a court in Paris ruled in 1971 against plagiarism, stating that many songs were based on similar constant factors.

Recording
The track was recorded on April 11, 1966, one month before the rest of the album. Hal Blaine was the drummer and Glen Campbell played rhythm guitar. According to Blaine, he reused the iconic drum beat from ""Be My Baby"" by the Ronettes in a slower and softer arrangement.

One of the most memorable and recognizable features of the record is Sinatra's scat improvisation of the melody (on take two) with the syllables ""doo-be-doo-be-doo"" as the song fades to the end. For the CD Nothing but the Best, the song was remastered and the running time is 2:45 instead of the usual 2:35. The extra ten seconds is just a continuation of Sinatra's scat singing. In 1968, CBS television executive Fred Silverman was inspired by the scat whilst listening to the recording on a red-eye flight to a development meeting for a Saturday morning cartoon show and decided to rename the dog character to ""Scooby-Doo"".

Sinatra despised the song, calling it at one time ""a piece of shit"" and ""the worst fucking song that I have ever heard."" He was not afraid to voice his disapproval of playing it live. In spite of his contempt for the song, it gave him a number one hit for the first time in 11 years, and remained on the charts for 15 weeks.

The single sold 60,000 copies in Brazil, 600,000 copies in France, combined it sold a million copies in United States and United Kingdom and over 2 million worldwide.

It is in this area that General William T. Sherman engaged the Confederate Army on his advance from Savannah, and after two days of battle, outflanked the Confederates and forced them to withdraw.  River Bridge State Park was listed in the National Register of Historic Places on February 23, 1972.

Mass Grave
In 1876 men from nearby communities reburied the Confederate dead from Rivers Bridge in a mass grave about a mile from the battlefield and began a tradition of annually commemorating the battle. The Rivers Bridge Memorial Association eventually obtained the battlefield and in 1945 turned the site over to South Carolina for a state park.
